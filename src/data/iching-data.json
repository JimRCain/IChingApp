It simply moves, endlessly, like breath, like a heartbeat. To be strong and untiring is not to push against the world, but to remain so deeply yourself that you never need to stop.

It is simply the natural result of being real—others feel it, the way they feel sunlight without being told.",

The sage works all day, then returns to silence. Can you?",

Two paths open: to soar higher into the world's view, or to dive deep into solitude and self-discovery. Neither is wrong. The only mistake is to choose from fear. Ask the depths which way is yours.",

The dragon that was hidden, then appearing, then active, then hovering, now flies free across the sky. This is not conquest—it is fulfillment. Like a tree that has reached its full height and now simply offers shade. Those who see you at this stage are blessed not by your power, but by your completion.",
        "Arrogant dragon will have cause to repent. The sky has no top. To keep climbing beyond yourself is to leave the earth entirely, to become nothing.

The sky does not try to be vast; it is vast, and so it holds the stars. The sage does not try to lead; they are real, and so others follow—not because they are pushed, but because they recognize something they already carry within themselves.

When you are simply yourself, fully, without pretense, your actions become like the earth: direct, containing, vast. You need not practice being what you already are.",

Not hidden because you are hiding, but hidden because the work does not need your name on it.

This is not self-effacement—it is the wisdom of knowing when your presence is the gift, not your label.",

Learn when to tie the sack, and when to loosen it.",

This is supreme good fortune: to be exactly where you belong, doing exactly what is yours to do, asking nothing more.",

This is the power of true humility: not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less. The mare does not try to be fast like the dragon; she runs her own run, and in that running, she is complete.

All the elements are present, but not yet resolved. In this tension, the wise one begins to weave—bringing together what is separate, ordering what is chaotic.

Like testing the ice with one foot before trusting it with your whole weight, you wait, you feel, you gather those who can see what you cannot. The hesitation itself, when conscious, becomes part of the path.",

Things fall apart—the horse leaves the wagon, what was joined now separates. But this is not disaster; it is the natural sorting of what does not belong together. Wait, like the maiden who will not give herself to the wrong one. Even if it takes ten years, the right alignment will come. Do not force what is not ready to join.",

To pursue something without the proper guide, without understanding the territory, is to lose yourself in the thicket. The forester knows the land, knows the habits of the deer. If you hunt without them, you will stumble in blindness. There are times when giving up is not failure—it is the wisdom of recognizing you are not ready. The noble one reads the signs and knows when to wait.",
        "Horse and wagon part. Seek union. To go brings good fortune. Everything acts favorably. After the separation, the seeking. The horse that left now returns, or a new horse appears. The scattering was not permanent—it was the clearing of space for a truer joining. Now you can seek, and the seeking itself is blessed. The movement that was forbidden in the first line is now possible, because the ground has been tested, the helpers gathered, the timing matured. Go now.",

But to pour a flood on it, to try to force growth with great effort, drowns it. You are being blessed, but the blessing comes drop by drop. Accept the little that is given. Do not demand the full abundance before the plant can hold it. Patience in receiving is as important as patience in striving.",

Water does not fight the rock; it flows around it, and in flowing, finds its way to the sea. To find peace in perseverance—the perseverance of the changed course—is good fortune indeed.",

The great person does not take sides; they reveal the center.",

This is the ultimate teaching of Conflict: there is no victory in it that lasts. The only true resolution is the one that restores alignment, not the one that proves you right."
