  heart: "Thunder over lake. Thunder stirs, the lake responds—but the union is not equal. The marrying maiden is a secondary wife, entering a household not as the principal but as a supplement. Her position is precarious; her influence, limited. This hexagram speaks of relationships entered without full commitment, of unions that serve a purpose but lack depth. The wise one in such a situation does not demand what cannot be given; they accept the limits and make the best of what is.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "歸妹。征凶，无攸利。",
    rendering: "The Marrying Maiden. To undertake something brings misfortune. Nothing that would further."
  },
  judgment: "This is not a time for great undertakings. The position is secondary, the power limited. To push for more, to demand equality where it is not offered, brings misfortune. Nothing furthers because the foundation is not solid. Yet the maiden can still find her way: by accepting her place with grace, by fulfilling her role with sincerity, she may earn a deeper regard. But do not mistake this hexagram for a call to action. It is a call to patience, to clarity about what is possible, and to dignity within constraint.",
  image: "Thunder over lake. The noble one understands the transitory in the light of the eternity of the end. Thunder over lake: the stirring is temporary, the lake endures. The noble one learns: understand the transitory—what passes, what is temporary. See it in light of the end—what endures, what remains. In a secondary position, do not grasp for permanence. Accept the moment, fulfill the role, and let the eternal speak through the temporary.",

    "The marrying maiden as a concubine. A lame man can still tread. Setting forth brings good fortune. The lowest position, the least status. Yet like a lame man who can still walk, she can still move, still act. Setting forth—within her limits—brings good fortune. Do what you can with what you have.",
    "A one-eyed man can still see. The perseverance of a solitary man furthers. Limited vision, but not blindness. The solitary man—one without allies—can still persevere. In a secondary position, you may see less, have less support, but you can still see truly. Persevere in that seeing.",
    "The marrying maiden waits. She returns as a concubine. The waiting is not passive; it is preparation. She returns—not to the same place, but to a similar role. The line does not judge; it describes. Some returns are necessary; some waiting is wise.",
    "The marrying maiden draws out the time. She may be late in marrying. There is a time for delay. To draw out the time is not to waste it; it is to wait for the right moment. Late, but not too late.",
    "The sovereign I gave his daughter in marriage. The embroidered garments of the princess were not as fine as those of the concubine. The moon is nearly full. Good fortune. The princess—the primary wife—is outshone by the concubine's virtue. The moon is nearly full; her influence grows. Good fortune because quality, not status, determines worth. The secondary position does not diminish true excellence.",
    "The woman holds the basket, but there are no fruits in it. The man stabs the sheep, but no blood flows. Nothing that furthers. Empty rituals, forms without substance. The basket is held, but empty; the sheep is stabbed, but no blood flows. The union produces nothing because the heart is not in it. This is the danger of the secondary position: becoming mere form, losing substance. Do not let this happen. Even in constraint, be real."

    description: "Lake below, thunder above. Thunder stirs the lake, but the lake does not rise to meet it. This is the marrying maiden: a union that is not fully reciprocal, a relationship of unequal power. The lake receives the thunder's energy but cannot return it. In such a situation, the wise one accepts the gift without demanding more, and uses what is given to grow in stillness."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'To know the masculine and keep to the feminine is to be the valley of the world.' Hexagram 54 is the feminine kept, the valley that receives without demanding. The marrying maiden, in her secondary position, can still be a valley—deep, receptive, nourishing. The thunder comes and goes; the lake remains. In the end, the valley outlasts the mountain. The one who accepts her place with grace may find that the place itself transforms."
