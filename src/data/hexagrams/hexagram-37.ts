  heart: "Wind over fire. Wind fans the flame, making it brighter, steadier. Fire warms the wind, giving it direction. This is the family: mutual influence, mutual support, each strengthening the other. Not through force, but through the natural interaction of their natures. The family is the first society, the original school of virtue. In it, we learn to be ourselves in relation to others, to give and receive, to hold and let go.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "家人。利女貞。",
    rendering: "The Family. Perseverance of the woman furthers."
  },
  judgment: "The family is the root of all order. In it, we learn the virtues that sustain the world: loyalty, patience, generosity, forgiveness. The perseverance of the woman—the receptive, the nurturing, the constant—furthers because it provides the steady ground on which the family rests. But the family requires both wind and fire, both the moving and the warming. Each has its place, its role. When each fulfills its nature, the family flourishes. When roles are confused or forced, the family weakens. Know your place in the family, and fill it fully.",
  image: "Wind over fire. The noble one speaks with substance and acts with constancy. Wind over fire: the wind moves, the fire responds. Their interaction is real, not abstract. The noble one learns: speak with substance—words that mean something, that come from the heart. Act with constancy—behavior that others can rely on. In the family, more than anywhere, substance and constancy matter. Your family knows you; you cannot pretend. So be real.",
  lines: [
    "Fences within the family. Regret disappears. Boundaries are necessary, even in the closest relationships. Fences mark where one ends and another begins. Without them, there is entanglement, confusion. With them, regret disappears because each knows their place and can be themselves within it.",
    "She should not follow her whims. She should attend within. Good fortune. The woman, the nurturing heart, should not be ruled by passing desires. Attend within—to the family, to the home, to the steady work of care. This is not limitation; it is the source of good fortune. The family needs someone who is reliably present, not chasing every impulse.",
    "If the family is severe, regret and danger, but good fortune. If woman and child giggle and snort, in the end there is humiliation. Better to be too strict than too lax. Severity may bring regret and danger—it is not pleasant—but it preserves order. Laxness, giggling, lack of discipline—this leads to humiliation because the family loses its shape. Choose the severity that holds, not the laxness that dissolves.",
    "The riches of the family. Great good fortune. When the family is in order, it generates wealth—not just money, but resources of all kinds: time, attention, love, support. This is great good fortune because it sustains not just the family but all who come near it.",
    "As a king, approach the family. Do not be concerned. Good fortune. The family is the model for all governance. As a king—as any leader—approach your people as you would your family: with love, with constancy, with attention. Do not be concerned about your status; simply be present. Good fortune follows.",
    "His work commands respect. In the end, good fortune. The one who has fulfilled their role in the family, who has been constant and real, commands respect not by demanding it but by earning it. In the end, good fortune comes—not as reward, but as the natural outcome of a life well lived in the first society."

    description: "Fire below, wind above. The wind fans the fire; the fire warms the wind. Their mutual influence is the family: each supporting the other, each becoming more itself through the relationship. The fire does not lose itself in the wind; it burns brighter. The wind does not lose itself in the fire; it moves more truly."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The great Tao has no name. Yet it nourishes and completes all things.' Hexagram 37 is the family as the Tao in miniature: a nameless order that nourishes and completes its members. Not through rules, but through relationship. Not through force, but through mutual influence. The family that follows the Tao needs no laws; it simply functions, like wind over fire, each doing what is natural, and the whole flourishing."
