  heart: "Mountain over mountain. Stillness doubled, stability compounded. The mountain does not move; it simply is. Keeping Still is not the absence of movement, but the presence of stillness within movement. The mountain stands through storms, through seasons, through centuries. It does not resist; it endures. In human life, Keeping Still is the ability to stop when stopping is required, to be still when stillness is the only right response. The mountain teaches: not everything that can be done should be done. Sometimes, the highest action is non-action.",

  judgment: "Keeping Still. Keeping the back still so that one no longer feels the body. Going into the courtyard and not seeing the person. No blame. This is the stillness that goes deep: you are so centered that you no longer feel the body's demands, so present that you do not see the person's distractions. You are simply still. No blame follows because you are not avoiding the world; you are finding the center from which the world can be met. Keeping Still is not withdrawal; it is preparation. From stillness, right action emerges.",
  image: "Mountains standing close. The image of Keeping Still. The noble one does not permit their thoughts to go beyond their situation. Mountains standing close: one mountain beside another, both still. The noble one learns: do not let thoughts go beyond the situation. Do not chase what is not here. Do not worry about what is not now. Be present in this moment, in this place, in this situation. The mountain does not long to be elsewhere. Neither should you.",

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The heavy is the root of the light. The still is the master of the restless.' Hexagram 52 is the still that masters the restless. The mountain does not chase the clouds; the clouds come and go. The mountain does not resist the wind; the wind blows and passes. The wise one is like the mountain: still, present, unmoved by what comes and goes. In stillness, everything finds its place."
