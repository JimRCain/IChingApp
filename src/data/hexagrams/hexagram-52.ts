  heart: "Mountain over mountain. Stillness upon stillness. The mountain does not move; it simply rests. Keeping Still is the art of stopping—not as avoidance, but as completion. When the spine is still, the body rests. When the mind is still, the world settles. The sage knows when to stop: at the right moment, in the right place, with no regret.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "艮其背，不獲其身，行其庭，不見其人。无咎。",
    rendering: "Keeping Still. Keeping his back still, he is no longer aware of his body. Walking in his courtyard, he does not see his neighbors. No blame."
  },
  judgment: "To keep the back still is to let the world go. When the spine is still, the body is forgotten. When the self is forgotten, others are not objects of grasping. Walking in the courtyard, you do not see your neighbors—not because you reject them, but because you are not seeking. No blame attends this stillness. It is the ground of all right action. From stillness, when you do move, you move truly.",
  image: "Mountains standing together. The noble one does not let his thoughts go beyond his situation. Mountains together: they rest, they endure. The noble one learns: do not let thoughts go beyond your situation. Be fully here, in this moment, with what is. Thoughts that wander are like streams that leave the mountain; they do not return. Keep your mind on what is present, and you will not be scattered.",

    "Keeping his toes still. No blame. Perseverance furthers. The toes—the beginning of movement. To still them before they move is wise. No blame because you have not yet taken a wrong step. Persevere in this early stillness, and it will further all that follows.",
    "Keeping his calves still. He cannot rescue him whom he follows. His heart is not glad. The calves move with the legs; they are not independent. If you still them after movement has begun, you cannot rescue the one you follow—your own impulse. The heart is not glad because the timing is off. Better to still earlier, or not at all.",
    "Keeping his hips still. Makes his ribs rigid. Danger. The heart suffocates. To still the hips—the center of movement—after you are already in motion makes the whole body rigid. The ribs lock; the heart cannot breathe. Danger because you are fighting yourself. If you must still, still at the source, not in mid-motion.",
    "Keeping his trunk still. No blame. The trunk—the core, the center. To still the center is to find balance. No blame because you are not preventing movement; you are grounding it. From this still center, all movement can arise cleanly.",
    "Keeping his jaws still. Words have order. Regret disappears. The jaws—speech. To still them is to speak only when words are true and ordered. Regret disappears because you do not speak in haste. The stillness of the jaws is not silence; it is the pause before right speech.",
    "Keeping his back still. Good fortune. The culmination: the back, the spine, the deepest support. To keep the back still is to be so grounded that the body is forgotten. Good fortune because you are no longer reacting to the world; you are simply present, and from that presence, all action is true."

    description: "Mountain over mountain. Stillness upon stillness. This is the meditation of form: each mountain rests, each moment completes. The wise one learns that true stillness is not a void; it is the full presence of what is, unmoving and complete."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'Do you have the patience to wait till your mud settles and the water is clear? Can you remain unmoving till the right action arises by itself?' Hexagram 52 is the answer: yes. Keeping still is not passivity; it is the deepest activity. The mountain does not move, yet all things grow around it. The sage does not strive, yet all things are accomplished. In stillness, the mud settles, the water clears, and right action arises of itself."
