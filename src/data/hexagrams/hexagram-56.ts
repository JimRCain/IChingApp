  heart: "Fire over mountain. The fire burns on the mountain, but does not stay. It moves, consuming what is in its path, then moves on. The wanderer is this: one who has no fixed home, no permanent place. Not by choice, always, but by circumstance. The wanderer learns to be light, to carry little, to attach to nothing. The mountain remains; the fire passes. The wanderer, too, passes through, leaving no trace.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "旅。小亨，旅貞吉。",
    rendering: "The Wanderer. Success through smallness. The wanderer who perseveres is fortunate."
  },
  judgment: "Success through smallness. The wanderer cannot carry much; they must travel light. Great undertakings are not for the wanderer—they require roots, stability, the luxury of time. But small things, the wanderer can do well. Perseverance brings good fortune because the wanderer who remains true to themselves, who does not lose their center despite constant movement, finds a kind of freedom the settled never know. Home is not a place; it is a way of being.",
  image: "Fire on the mountain. The noble one is clear-minded and cautious in imposing penalties. Fire on the mountain: it burns bright but does not stay. The noble one learns: be clear-minded—see things as they are, without the distortion of attachment. Be cautious in imposing penalties—know that you are passing through, that your judgments will be judged in turn. The wanderer does not have the luxury of long consequences; they must be right the first time.",
  lines: [
    "If the wanderer busies himself with trivial things, he draws down misfortune upon himself. The wanderer who focuses on trifles—who argues over small things, who clings to petty concerns—draws misfortune. Not because the things are small, but because the wanderer's energy is limited. Spend it on what matters. Let the trivial pass.",
    "The wanderer comes to an inn. He has his property with him. He wins the steadfastness of a young servant. The wanderer finds an inn—a temporary resting place. He has his property—what he carries is his own. He wins a servant—not through force, but through genuine connection. Even the wanderer can find loyalty, if they are true.",
    "The wanderer's inn burns down. He loses the steadfastness of his young servant. Danger. The inn burns—what was temporary is destroyed. The servant leaves—loyalty was conditional on comfort. Danger because the wanderer is exposed, alone. But this is also the wanderer's lesson: nothing is permanent. Not the inn, not the servant, not the comfort. Only the walking continues.",
    "The wanderer rests in a shelter. He obtains his property and an ax. My heart is not glad. He rests in a shelter—more secure than an inn. He obtains property and an ax—tools, resources. But his heart is not glad. Why? Because the wanderer knows: this too will pass. The ax that builds can also destroy. The shelter that protects can also trap. The wanderer's heart cannot rest fully because resting is not the wanderer's nature.",
    "He shoots a pheasant. It drops with the first arrow. In the end this brings both praise and office. The wanderer hunts—takes what he needs. The pheasant drops with the first arrow—skill, precision. In the end, praise and office come. The wanderer, through competence, through doing what is needed, earns recognition. Not because they sought it, but because excellence is visible even in the passing.",
    "The bird's nest burns up. The wanderer laughs at first, then must needs lament and weep. Through carelessness he loses his cow. Misfortune. The nest burns—home, security, gone. The wanderer laughs at first—perhaps thinking himself free of attachment. But then he must lament, weep. Through carelessness, he loses his cow—the source of nourishment, of wealth. Misfortune because the wanderer forgot: even detachment requires care. To carry nothing is not to care for nothing."

    description: "Mountain below, fire above. Fire on the mountain—burning, moving, not staying. This is the wanderer: one who passes through, who does not put down roots. The mountain endures; the fire passes. The wanderer learns to be like fire: bright, warm, but unattached."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The sage travels all day without leaving home.' Hexagram 56 is the wanderer who has learned this truth: home is not a place you arrive at; it is a way you travel. The fire on the mountain does not mourn its passing; it simply burns while it burns. The wanderer who has found the Tao does not long for settlement; they find home in the walking itself. To travel without attachment, to move without anxiety, to pass through without leaving traces—this is the wanderer's freedom."
