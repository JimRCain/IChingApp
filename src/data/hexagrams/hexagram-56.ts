  heart: "Fire over mountain. Fire burns on the mountain, bright but not rooted. The wanderer is one who travels, who has no fixed home. They are exposed, dependent on the hospitality of others. Yet the wanderer also sees new lands, meets new people, grows in ways the settled cannot. The hexagram counsels: be prudent, be modest, attach yourself to what is reliable, and do not stay too long. The wanderer's path is one of constant learning, constant leaving.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "旅。小亨，旅貞吉。",
    rendering: "The Wanderer. Success in small matters. Perseverance brings good fortune to the wanderer."
  },
  judgment: "The wanderer does not seek great things. Small successes are enough. Perseverance in the wandering life brings good fortune—not because you accumulate, but because you learn. In each new place, be modest. Attach yourself to what is trustworthy. Do not stay beyond your welcome. The wanderer who follows these rules will always find a place to rest. The fire on the mountain burns brightly, but it does not consume the mountain; it accepts its temporary home.",
  image: "Fire over mountain. The noble one is clear-minded and cautious in imposing penalties. Fire over mountain: the light reveals, but the mountain remains. The noble one learns: be clear-minded—see what is. Be cautious in imposing penalties—the wanderer has no local knowledge, no deep ties. Do not judge too quickly. In a strange place, mercy is wiser than strictness.",
  lines: [
    "The wanderer is busy with trivial things. Thus he brings misfortune upon himself. The first mistake: fussing over small matters, losing sight of the larger context. The wanderer, anxious, busies himself with trifles and brings misfortune. Relax. See the whole.",
    "The wanderer comes to an inn. He has his possessions with him. He wins the heart of a young servant. The inn—a temporary home. Possessions—what he carries. The servant—a local connection. Good fortune because he finds shelter and a bond. The wanderer needs both: a place to rest and someone to trust.",
    "The wanderer's inn burns down. He loses the heart of his young servant. Danger. The inn destroyed, the bond broken. Danger because his supports are gone. The line does not offer comfort; it simply records. In wandering, losses come. The only response is to move on.",
    "The wanderer rests in a shelter. He has his possessions with him. But my heart is not glad. A shelter, not a home. Possessions, but not peace. The heart is not glad because the wandering itself is wearying. This line acknowledges the cost of the path. Even with necessities, the soul may ache.",
    "He shoots a pheasant. It drops with the first arrow. In the end, he gets praise and a mandate. A small success—the pheasant falls. But from this small act, he earns praise and a mandate. In wandering, small deeds can lead to recognition. Do not despise the small.",
    "The bird's nest burns up. The wanderer first laughs, then cries. He loses his cow. Misfortune. The final loss: the nest, the home, the cow—the resource. First laughter (denial? relief?), then tears. Misfortune because everything is gone. The wanderer must now wander with nothing. Yet even this is not the end; it is the deepest teaching of impermanence."

    description: "Mountain below, fire above. Fire rests on the mountain, bright but temporary. The wanderer is like this: a visitor, a guest. The mountain endures; the fire moves on. In wandering, accept that you are not the mountain. You are the fire, here today, gone tomorrow. Burn brightly while you stay."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The good traveler leaves no tracks.' Hexagram 56 is the traveler who leaves light tracks, who does not cling, who moves through the world like fire over mountain—bright, warm, and gone. The wanderer's path is the path of non-attachment. You have no permanent home, so you are at home everywhere. You have no fixed identity, so you can become anyone. The sage wanders through life as through a foreign country—curious, humble, free. And in the end, they leave no tracks because they never claimed any ground."
