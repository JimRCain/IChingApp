  heart: "Lake over water. The lake is empty, the water below is trapped—no outlet, no replenishment. Oppression is this: exhaustion, constraint, the sense of being trapped with no way out. Not by your fault, not by anyone's fault—simply the condition of the moment. The sage in oppression does not rage; they accept, they wait, they trust. The water is still there, though hidden. The lake will be filled again.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "困。亨，貞，大人吉，无咎。有言不信。",
    rendering: "Oppression. Success. Perseverance. The great person brings good fortune. No blame. But words are not believed."
  },
  judgment: "Oppression seems the opposite of success, yet the hexagram says: Oppression has success. How? Through perseverance, through inner alignment. The great person—the one who has cultivated virtue—brings good fortune even in oppression, not by changing circumstances, but by changing themselves. No blame attaches because they did not cause their plight. But words are not believed; in oppression, explanations fail, pleas go unheard. The only path is silent endurance, inner work, and trust that the water will eventually rise again.",
  image: "Lake over water. The noble one stakes his life on following his purpose. Lake over water: the lake is empty, the water trapped. The noble one learns: in oppression, the only thing left is purpose. Stake your life on it—not recklessly, but with the deep commitment that says: even if I lose everything, I will not lose this. Purpose becomes the ground when all other ground is gone.",

    "He sits oppressed under a bare tree. He wanders into a dark valley. For three years he sees nothing.",
    "He is oppressed while at meat and drink. The man with the scarlet knee bands is just coming. It furthers to offer sacrifice. To set forth brings misfortune. No blame.",
    "He is oppressed by stone. He leans on thorns. He enters his house and does not see his wife. Misfortune.",
    "He comes slowly, oppressed in a golden carriage. Humiliation, but the end is reached.",
    "His nose and feet are cut off. Oppression at the hands of the man with the scarlet knee bands. Joy comes slowly. It furthers to offer sacrifice and libation.",
    "He is oppressed by creeping vines. He moves uncertainly. Regret. If he thinks of his mistakes, he has no regret. To move now brings good fortune."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'To know the masculine and keep to the feminine is to be the valley of the world.' Hexagram 47 is the valley when it is dry, the feminine when it is empty. Oppression is the condition of being a valley with no water, a well with no source. Yet the valley remains valley; its nature does not change. In oppression, keep to your nature. Be the valley, even dry. The water will return."
