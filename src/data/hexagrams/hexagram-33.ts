  heart: "Mountain under heaven. The mountain rises, but heaven recedes. There are times when the only wise response is to withdraw—not in fear, but in recognition that the moment is not yours. The mountain does not chase the sky; it rests in its own massiveness, letting heaven do what heaven does. Retreat is not defeat; it is alignment with the natural order. When the tide goes out, the wise fisher does not chase the water; they wait.",

    chinese: "遯。亨，小利貞。",
    rendering: "Retreat succeeds. In small matters, perseverance furthers."
  },
  judgment: "Retreat is not running away; it is choosing the right moment to step back. Success comes to those who recognize when the time is not ripe for advance. In small matters, perseverance furthers—you can still attend to the details, still maintain your integrity, still prepare. But in great matters, wait. The mountain does not try to stop the sky from receding; it simply remains mountain. When the tide returns, you will still be here.",
  image: "Mountain under heaven. The noble one keeps the petty person at a distance, not with anger but with dignity. Mountain under heaven: the mountain is great, but it does not try to fill the sky. It keeps its distance naturally, by being what it is. The noble one learns: when faced with the petty, the small-minded, the unready, do not fight or flee in panic. Simply keep your distance, with dignity. Let your presence itself be the retreat. They will feel the space you hold and either grow or move on.",

    "At the tail in retreat. This is dangerous. Do not undertake anything. To be last in retreat, to hesitate too long, is dangerous. The tail is caught. Now, do not undertake anything—any action now will only worsen the position. Wait for a better moment.",
    "He holds him fast with yellow oxhide. No one can tear him loose. Yellow is the color of the center, of earth. Oxhide is strong, flexible. To hold to the center with flexible strength—this is the retreat that succeeds. No force can tear you from this holding because you are not attached to outcome, only to truth.",
    "A halted retreat brings danger and distress. To keep people and servants brings good fortune. If you halt the retreat, if you try to stay when you should go, you bring distress upon yourself. But if you attend to those close to you—people and servants, your immediate circle—that brings good fortune. Even in retreat, you can care for what is near.",
    "A noble person in retreat brings good fortune. A petty person cannot. The noble one retreats with grace, with dignity, and this very retreat brings good fortune because it preserves their essence. The petty person, attached to position and appearance, cannot retreat; they cling and are destroyed.",
    "Friendly retreat. Perseverance brings good fortune. To retreat with friends, with companions who understand, is blessed. You are not alone in your withdrawal; you have those who share your sense of timing. Persevere in this friendly retreat, and good fortune follows.",
    "Cheerful retreat. Everything furthers. The highest retreat: not grudging, not fearful, but cheerful. You see clearly that this is the right moment, and you withdraw with joy, trusting the return. Everything furthers because you are aligned, not resistant."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'Yield and overcome; empty and become full; bend and become straight.' Hexagram 33 is the art of yielding, of retreating not to lose but to win. The highest good is like water—it yields to every obstacle, yet in the end, nothing can stop it. Retreat is water's way: go around, wait, return. The mountain will still be here when the sky comes back."
