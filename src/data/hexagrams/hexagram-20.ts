  heart: "Wind above, earth below. The wind moves across the earth, unseen but felt. This is contemplation: not the staring of the eye, but the seeing of the whole. The wind does not look at the earth; it knows the earth by moving across it. The earth does not look at the wind; it knows the wind by being moved. Contemplation is this knowing: not the knowledge of the observer about the observed, but the knowledge of participation, of being part of what you behold.",

    chinese: "觀。盥而不薦，有孚顒若。",
    rendering: "Contemplation. The ablution has been performed, but not the offering. Full of trust they look up."
  },
  judgment: "Contemplation. The ablution has been performed, but not the offering. Full of trust they look up. The ablution—the washing, the purification—has been performed. You are ready. But the offering has not yet been made. This is the moment of contemplation: between the preparation and the action, between the cleansing and the giving. In this moment, you look up, full of trust. Not the trust of certainty, but the trust of openness. You do not know what will come, but you are ready to receive it.",
  image: "The wind blows over the earth. The image of Contemplation. The ancient kings visited the regions of the world, contemplated the people, and gave them instruction. The wind over the earth: invisible, but its effects are everywhere. The ancient kings understood this. They did not stay in their palaces; they visited the regions. They did not command from afar; they contemplated the people. They did not impose; they instructed. This is contemplation in action: to see by being present, to teach by being with, to lead by following the contours of the land.",

    "Boy-like contemplation. For inferior people, no blame. For superior people, humiliation. The contemplation is boy-like—simple, naive, unformed. For inferior people, this is no blame; they are not expected to see deeply. But for superior people, this is humiliation. You are capable of more. Do not settle for the surface. Go deeper.",
    "Contemplation through the crack of the door. Furtherance for the perseverance of a woman. The contemplation is limited—through the crack of the door, not the full opening. This is furtherance for the perseverance of a woman—for the receptive, the patient, the one who can wait. But it is not the full view. If you are called to more, widen the door.",
    "Contemplation of my life decides the choice between advance and retreat. You contemplate your own life—not the world, not others, but your own path. This contemplation decides: advance or retreat. Not based on fear or desire, but on clear seeing. You know when to move forward and when to pull back. This is the power of self-contemplation: it guides action.",
    "Contemplation of the light of the kingdom. It furthers one to exert influence as the guest of a king. You contemplate the light of the kingdom—the center, the source, the guiding vision. This contemplation furthers one to exert influence as the guest of a king. You are not the king; you are the guest. But as a guest, you have influence. You bring an outside perspective. You see what those inside cannot see. Use this gift.",
    "Contemplation of my life. The noble one is without blame. You contemplate your life again—but now with the depth that comes from practice. The noble one who does this is without blame. Not because they are perfect, but because they are aware. They see their path, and they walk it with eyes open.",
    "Contemplation of his life. The noble one is without blame. Now you contemplate not only your own life but his life—the life of the other, the life of the whole. This broader contemplation also brings the noble one without blame. You have moved from self to other, from part to whole. This is the completion of contemplation: to see yourself in the other, and the other in yourself."

    description: "Earth below, wind above. The wind moves over the earth, observing by touching. The earth receives the wind, being observed by being moved. This is contemplation: not the distant gaze, but the close presence. The wind does not stand apart from the earth; it flows across it. The earth does not resist the wind; it responds to it. In this mutual participation, true seeing happens."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'Without going out the door, know the world. Without looking out the window, see the Tao of heaven. The further one goes, the less one knows.' Hexagram 20 is the paradox of contemplation: to see the world, do not travel endlessly. To see the Tao, do not search outward. Contemplate what is before you. The wind knows the earth not by circling it from afar, but by blowing across it. The earth knows the wind not by studying it, but by being moved. In your own contemplation, find this same intimacy. Do not seek the distant view; seek the near truth. The window you look through is your own life. The door you walk through is your own path. Know this, and you know the world."
