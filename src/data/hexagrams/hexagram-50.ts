  heart: "Fire over wood. The flame licks the cauldron, heating what is within. The cauldron is the vessel of transformation—raw becomes cooked, separate becomes one, nourishing. It is not the food itself, but the means by which food becomes gift. In human life, the cauldron is culture, tradition, the vessel that transforms raw experience into wisdom, crude energy into refined virtue. It holds, it cooks, it offers.",

    chinese: "鼎。元吉，亨。",
    rendering: "The Cauldron. Supreme good fortune. Success."

  judgment: "The cauldron is the sacred vessel, the means by which raw material becomes nourishment. Supreme good fortune attends those who tend it rightly. Success comes not from the ingredients alone, but from the vessel that holds them and the fire that transforms them. In your life, what is the cauldron? It may be your practice, your community, your tradition—whatever holds you and transforms you. Tend it well. Keep it clean. Feed the fire, but do not let it burn too hot. The cauldron is patient; it waits for the right cooking. So too, you must wait for the transformation to complete before offering what is within.",
  image: "Fire over wood. The noble one consolidates their destiny by making their position correct. Fire over wood: the wood feeds the fire; the fire transforms the wood. The noble one learns: consolidate your destiny—not by grasping, but by making your position correct. Be in the right place, doing the right thing, with the right attitude. Then destiny flows to you as naturally as fire rises from wood. The position correct, the vessel stable, the transformation proceeds.",

    "The cauldron is overturned, its feet up. It furthers to remove what is stale. Taking a concubine for the sake of her son brings no blame. Sometimes the cauldron must be overturned to clean it. The stale, the old, must be removed. Taking a concubine—an unconventional means—for the sake of a son, for the future, is not blameworthy. The overturning is not destruction; it is preparation.",
    "The cauldron has food. My comrades are envious. But they cannot harm me. Good fortune. The cauldron is full, but envy arises. Those who see your nourishment may wish they had it. But they cannot harm you because your fullness is not at their expense. Good fortune because you are secure in your abundance.",
    "The cauldron's ears are worn out. The way is blocked. The fat of the pheasant is not eaten. Only when rain falls will regret disappear. Good fortune in the end. The ears—the means of lifting the cauldron—are worn; the way is blocked. The nourishment cannot be accessed. Only when rain falls—when heaven's blessing comes—will regret disappear. But in the end, good fortune. The blockage is temporary.",
    "The cauldron's feet are broken. The prince's meal is spilled. The servant is drenched. Misfortune. Catastrophe: the vessel breaks, the food is lost, the servant is soiled. Misfortune because the transformation was interrupted, the gift wasted. But the line does not end in despair; it simply records. From such failure, one learns to tend the vessel better.",
    "The cauldron has yellow ears and golden rings. Perseverance brings good fortune. Yellow—center, earth. Golden—value, stability. The vessel is well made, well tended. Perseverance in this care brings good fortune. The cauldron is ready for any offering.",
    "The cauldron has rings of jade. Great good fortune. Nothing that does not further. Jade—the most precious, the most sacred. The cauldron adorned with jade is the vessel at its highest. Great good fortune because it is honored and capable. Nothing that does not further—every use of this vessel brings blessing. The transformation it enables is complete, holy, and eternal."

    description: "Wind below, fire above. Wood feeds fire; fire transforms wood. This is the cauldron: the vessel that holds and transforms. The wind is the wood, the fuel; the fire is the heat, the agent of change. Together, they cook what is raw into what nourishes. The cauldron is the sacred space where transformation happens."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The Tao is like an empty vessel that is yet inexhaustible. It is bottomless, perhaps the ancestor of all things.' Hexagram 50 is that vessel made visible. The cauldron is empty, yet it holds all that can be cooked. It is passive, yet it enables the most active transformation. In your life, be the cauldron: empty enough to receive, stable enough to hold, patient enough to let the fire do its work. Then what you offer will nourish all who come."
