  heart: "Fire over wood. The cauldron sits on wood, fire burns beneath it, transforming raw ingredients into nourishment. The Cauldron is the vessel of transformation, the sacred container where the old is cooked into the new. After revolution comes the cauldron: the work of culture, of refinement, of making the raw cooked. The cauldron is not just a pot; it is the symbol of civilization itself, the place where heaven and earth meet to create something that sustains life.",

  judgment: "The Cauldron brings supreme good fortune and success. After the revolution has cleared away the old, the cauldron transforms what remains into nourishment for the new order. This is the work of culture: to take the raw materials of life and cook them into wisdom, into art, into community. The cauldron is stable, grounded, sacred. It does not rush; it simmers. Supreme good fortune comes to those who tend the cauldron with care, who understand that transformation takes time.",
  image: "Fire over wood. The image of the Cauldron. The noble one consolidates their fate by making their position correct. Fire over wood: the flame cooks what is in the cauldron. The noble one learns: to consolidate fate, make your position correct. Not through force, but through alignment. The cauldron must be stable, level, or the contents spill. So too, you must be centered, balanced, or your life spills. Make your position correct, and fate consolidates around you.",

    "The handle of the ting is altered. One is impeded in his way of life. The fat of the pheasant is not eaten. Once rain falls, remorse is spent. Good fortune comes in the end.",
    "The legs of the ting are broken. The prince's meal is spilled. His person is soiled. Misfortune.",
    "The ting has yellow handles, golden carrying rings. Perseverance furthers.",
    "The ting has rings of jade. Great good fortune. Nothing that would not act to further."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The Tao is empty, yet use will not drain it. Deep, it is like the ancestor of the ten thousand things.' Hexagram 50 is the cauldron as the empty vessel that transforms. The cauldron is empty, yet it nourishes all. It does not claim the food it cooks; it simply serves. The wise one is like the cauldron: empty, useful, nourishing, claiming nothing."
