  heart: "Water over lake. The lake fills, but the water stops at its banks. Limitation is not deprivation; it is form. Without banks, the lake would spread and disappear. Without limits, life would dissipate. The wise one accepts limitation as the condition of all meaningful existence. Not to be constrained, but to be shaped. A river without banks is a flood; a life without limits is chaos.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "節。亨。苦節不可貞。",
    rendering: "Limitation. Success. Bitter limitation should not be persevered in."
  },
  judgment: "Limitation succeeds because it gives form to energy. The lake's banks allow it to be deep, to reflect, to sustain life. So too, your limits allow you to be present, to focus, to create. But bitter limitation—restriction that chafes, that crushes—should not be persevered in. Know the difference between the bank that holds and the bank that imprisons. The wise one accepts the first and resists the second.",
  image: "Water over lake. The noble one creates number and measure, and examines virtue and conduct. Water over lake: the level is fixed, the measure clear. The noble one learns: create number and measure—standards, limits, forms. Examine virtue and conduct—see if they fit within the measure. Limitation is not arbitrary; it is the wisdom of appropriateness. What fits, flourishes. What does not, must change.",
  lines: [
    "Not going out of the door and the courtyard. No blame. The first limitation: staying home, within bounds. No blame because you are not yet ready for wider movement. Know your limits and respect them.",
    "Not going out of the gate and the courtyard brings misfortune. The same action, but now it is too late. Staying within when you should go out brings misfortune. Limitation must be appropriate to time. The line warns: do not cling to limits that have outlived their use.",
    "He who knows no limitation will have cause to lament. No blame. The one without limits laments—because life without form is chaos. But the line says no blame—perhaps because they did not know better. Yet the lament itself is the teacher.",
    "Contented limitation. Good fortune. The ideal: limitation that is accepted, even embraced. Not bitter, not restrictive—contented. Good fortune because the limits fit like a well-made garment. They do not bind; they support.",
    "Sweet limitation brings good fortune. Going forward brings esteem. Limitation that is sweet—pleasant, welcome—brings good fortune. To go forward within these sweet limits brings esteem. Others see that you have found the balance between freedom and form.",
    "Bitter limitation. Perseverance brings misfortune. Regret disappears. The final warning: bitter limitation, if persevered in, brings misfortune. But regret disappears if you recognize it and let it go. The line offers a way out: see the bitterness, and release the limit that causes it."

    description: "Lake below, water above. The lake has its banks; the water has its channel. Limitation is this: the forms that contain and direct energy. The lake does not resent its banks; they make it deep. The water does not curse its channel; it makes it flow. So too, the wise one honors the limits that give life form."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The thirty spokes unite in one hub. It is the empty space that makes the wagon useful.' Hexagram 60 is the spokes and the hub—the limits that create the emptiness that is useful. Without spokes, no wheel. Without limits, no space. The sage does not fight limitation; they use it to create the container for what matters. The banks make the lake; the channel makes the river. Limitation is not the enemy of life; it is the midwife."
