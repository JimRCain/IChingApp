  heart: "Thunder over water. The storm breaks, the rain falls, the tension releases. Deliverance is this: the moment when what was bound is freed, when what was stuck moves again. Not by force, but by the natural release of accumulated pressure. Thunder rolls, rain pours, and the world breathes again. In human life, deliverance comes after long obstruction—sudden, welcome, complete. The knot unties; the path opens.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "解。利西南。无所往，其來復吉。有攸往，夙吉。",
    rendering: "Deliverance. The southwest furthers. If there is nowhere to go, coming back brings good fortune. If there is somewhere to go, acting quickly brings good fortune."
  },
  judgment: "After obstruction, deliverance. The southwest—the direction of openness, of yielding—furthers. If there is nowhere to go, if the way is still unclear, then coming back—returning to stillness—brings good fortune. Do not force the opening. But if there is somewhere to go, if the way is clear, then act quickly—夙吉, early good fortune. Do not delay once deliverance comes. The thunder does not hesitate; it rolls. The rain does not pause; it falls. When the moment of release arrives, meet it with equal swiftness.",
  image: "Thunder over water. The noble one forgives transgressions and pardons crimes. Thunder over water: the release of tension, the breaking of the storm. The noble one learns: in times of deliverance, forgive. Transgressions committed under pressure, crimes born of obstruction—these can now be pardoned. The release of outer tension allows the release of inner judgment. Deliverance is not just for you; extend it to others. Let the thunder wash away not only your own burdens but the burdens you have placed on others.",
  lines: [
    "No blame. The simplest line: in deliverance, there is no blame. The release is clean, complete. Do not look for fault; just accept the freedom.",
    "In the hunt, you catch three foxes. You receive a yellow arrow. Perseverance brings good fortune. Foxes are cunning, tricky—the lingering effects of obstruction. In deliverance, you catch them, you resolve them. You receive a yellow arrow—yellow, the color of the center, of earth. The arrow is guidance, direction. With this, persevere, and good fortune follows.",
    "If you carry a burden and ride in a wagon, you attract robbers. Perseverance brings danger. In deliverance, do not carry old burdens into new freedom. If you ride in the wagon of release while still holding the weight of what was, you attract robbers—those who will take advantage of your lingering attachment. Let the burden go. Travel light.",
    "Deliver yourself from your own weight. Trust, and friends will come. The first step is to release yourself—from your own expectations, your own judgments, your own weight. In that release, trust arises. And friends—those who will walk with you in the new openness—appear naturally.",
    "The noble person delivers themselves. Good fortune. They show themselves to the petty person. The noble one does not wait for deliverance from outside; they deliver themselves. This self-liberation brings good fortune. And in their freedom, they show themselves to the petty person—not to shame, but to offer an example. The petty person may not follow, but they have seen what is possible.",
    "The prince shoots at a hawk on a high wall. He kills it. Everything furthers. The hawk is the last obstacle, the one that still threatens from above. In deliverance, you must sometimes take decisive action to remove what endangers the new freedom. The prince—the one with authority, with clarity—shoots and kills it. Everything furthers now because the last threat is gone."

    description: "Water below, thunder above. Thunder over water—the storm breaks, the tension releases. This is deliverance: the sudden, liberating movement after long obstruction. The water, once blocked, now flows freely. The thunder, once pent up, now rolls across the sky. In deliverance, everything moves again."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'When the Tao is present in the universe, the horses haul manure. When the Tao is absent from the universe, warhorses are bred in the borderlands.' Hexagram 40 is the Tao present again, the horses returning to their peaceful work. After obstruction, after conflict, deliverance brings the world back to its natural state. The wise one does not hoard the release; they extend it to all, forgiving, pardoning, letting the thunder wash away not only their own burdens but the burdens of the world."
