  heart: "Thunder over mountain. The thunder is loud, but the mountain is still—a small excess of sound over substance. Preponderance of the Small is the condition where the small outweighs the great, where details overwhelm the whole. Not a crisis, but an imbalance. The wise one in such times attends to the small, corrects the excess, and restores harmony. Do not despise small things; they can tip the scale.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "小過。亨，利貞。可小事，不可大事。飛鳥遺之音，不宜上宜下，大吉。",
    rendering: "Preponderance of the Small. Success. Perseverance furthers. Small matters may be done; great matters should not be done. The flying bird leaves its song. It is better to descend than to ascend. Great good fortune."
  },
  judgment: "In times when the small preponderates, success comes through attending to small matters. Great undertakings are not advisable; they will be thrown off by the imbalance. The flying bird leaves its song—a small thing, but it carries meaning. It is better to descend than to ascend. Stay low, stay humble, tend the details. Great good fortune follows because you do not attempt what you cannot yet sustain. The mountain does not try to be thunder; it simply rests, and the thunder passes.",
  image: "Thunder over mountain. The noble one in his conduct is excessively humble. In mourning, he is excessively sorrowful. In his expenditures, he is excessively frugal. Thunder over mountain: a small excess of sound. The noble one learns: in conduct, be excessively humble—better too humble than too proud. In mourning, be excessively sorrowful—better to feel too much than too little. In expenditures, be excessively frugal—better to save too much than too little. When the small preponderates, lean into the small virtues. They will balance the scale.",
  lines: [
    "The bird meets with misfortune through flying. The bird that flies too high, that seeks the great when the small preponderates, meets misfortune. Stay low.",
    "She passes by her ancestor and meets her ancestress. He does not reach his ruler and meets his minister. No blame. To pass by the greater and meet the lesser—this is the way of the small preponderance. No blame because it is appropriate to the time.",
    "If you are not excessively careful, you may be attacked from behind. Danger. The small preponderance requires extra care. If you are not careful enough, danger comes. The line warns: in small matters, vigilance is protection.",
    "No blame. He meets him without passing by. Going brings danger. One must be on guard. Do not act. Perseverance brings good fortune. Meeting without passing—finding the right balance. Going forward now brings danger; be on guard. Do not act; simply persevere in awareness. Good fortune follows.",
    "Dense clouds, no rain from our western region. The prince shoots and hits him in the cave. The image from hexagram 9 returns: clouds gather, but no rain. The small preponderance has not yet become the great. The prince shoots and hits—a small action, precise, effective. In the cave, in hiddenness, the small act achieves what great force could not.",
    "He passes by, does not meet. The flying bird leaves him. Misfortune. This means calamity and injury. To pass by and not meet, to fly and miss connection—this is the misfortune of the small preponderance when it is not rightly handled. The bird leaves; the song is lost. Calamity and injury follow because the small was not attended to in time."

    description: "Mountain below, thunder above. Thunder over mountain—a small excess, a momentary imbalance. The mountain does not try to match the thunder; it remains still. The wise one in times of small preponderance does not attempt great things; they tend the small, correct the little imbalances, and wait for the thunder to pass."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The heavy is the root of the light. The still is the master of the restless.' Hexagram 62 is the light and restless in excess, the heavy and still as the remedy. When the small preponderates, return to the heavy, the still, the low. Descend, do not ascend. The bird that flies too high meets misfortune; the bird that stays near the earth hears its own song. The sage in times of imbalance does not seek to dominate; they become more humble, more careful, more still. In this, they become the root that stabilizes all."
