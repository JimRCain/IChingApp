  heart: "Lake over heaven. The lake rises, high above the land, threatening to overflow. Below, the creative power of heaven waits. Breakthrough is the moment of decision, the rupture, the final push through an obstruction that has long resisted. Not gentle, not patient—but necessary. The lake must break its banks; the truth must be spoken; the boil must be lanced. Breakthrough is the energy of resolution, of cutting through what has festered too long.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "夬。揚于王庭，孚號有厲。告自邑，不利即戎。利有攸往。",
    rendering: "Breakthrough. One must make one's message known in the king's court. It must be announced truthfully. Danger. One must notify one's own city. It does not further to resort to arms. It furthers one to undertake something."
  },
  judgment: "There comes a time when the hidden must be revealed, the blocked must be opened, the corrupt must be cut away. Breakthrough is that time. Make your message known in the king's court—speak truth to power. Announce it truthfully, even though there is danger. Notify your own city—prepare those close to you. But do not resort to arms; this is not a battle to be won by force, but a truth to be acknowledged by all. It furthers to undertake something—action now is necessary, but it must be action born of clarity, not aggression.",
  image: "Lake over heaven. The noble one bestows blessings but does not accumulate merit. Lake over heaven: the water is high, about to break through. The noble one learns: bestow blessings—give freely, let the water flow. But do not accumulate merit—do not count your good deeds, do not store up credit. The breakthrough is not about you; it is about clearing the way for all. When the lake breaks, it waters the plain; it does not ask for thanks.",
  lines: [
    "Mighty in the forward-striding toes. Going forward is not possible. One makes a mistake. The first impulse to break through, but the toes—the smallest part—are mighty, overeager. Going forward now is not possible; it would be a mistake. Wait until the whole body is ready.",
    "A cry of alarm. Weapons at night. Do not worry. The alarm sounds, the danger seems imminent. But do not worry. This is the false alarm, the fear that precedes the real breakthrough. Stay steady.",
    "Mighty in the cheekbones. Misfortune. The noble person is firmly resolved. He walks alone and meets rain. He is blamed. The cheekbones—the face, the identity—are too prominent. This brings misfortune because the breakthrough becomes personal. The noble one, firmly resolved, walks alone—isolated in his certainty. He meets rain—cleansing, but also discomfort. He is blamed by those who do not understand. Yet the line implies that this is the price of true breakthrough.",
    "There is no skin on his thighs. Walking comes hard. If he were led like a sheep, regret would disappear. But if he hears these words, he does not believe. The thighs bear the weight; without skin, without protection, walking is hard. If he could be led—if he could accept guidance—regret would disappear. But he does not believe; he is too caught in his own way. This is the danger of breakthrough: becoming deaf to counsel.",
    "In dealing with weeds, firm resolution is needed. Walking the middle way brings no blame. Weeds are persistent; they require firm action. But walk the middle way—not too much, not too little—and there is no blame. Breakthrough requires both strength and balance.",
    "No cry. In the end, misfortune. The final line: silence when speech is needed. No cry, no announcement, no breakthrough. The lake does not break; it stagnates. In the end, misfortune because the truth was not spoken, the abscess was not lanced, the moment was missed."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.' Hexagram 43 is the exception, the moment when not speaking is no longer possible. The lake that does not break becomes a swamp. The truth that is not spoken becomes a poison. Breakthrough is the speech of those who would rather be silent, the action of those who would rather wait. It is the last resort of the wise, and for that reason, when it comes, it must be true."
