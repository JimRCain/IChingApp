  heart: "Fire over earth. The sun rising over the great plain, illuminating everything, warming everything. Progress is this: not striving, not forcing, but the natural advance of light. The sun does not struggle to rise; it simply rises, and the world is lit. Progress in the human realm is the same: when you are clear, bright, and sincere, you advance without effort. The light itself opens the way.",

    rendering: "Progress. The noble prince is honored with horses in multitude. In a single day he is received three times."

  judgment: "True progress is like the sun at dawn: inevitable, gentle, and illuminating. When you are sincere and capable, recognition comes naturally—not because you sought it, but because your light is visible. The noble prince, honored with many horses, received three times in one day—this is not luck; it is the natural response of the world to genuine brightness. Progress is not about climbing; it is about becoming so fully yourself that the world cannot help but make space for you.",
  image: "Fire over earth. The noble one brightens their bright virtue. Fire over earth: the sun illuminates the plain, making everything visible. The noble one learns: brighten your bright virtue. Not acquire new virtue, but polish what is already there. Let your inherent goodness become more visible, more radiant. This polishing itself is progress. The sun does not become brighter; it simply becomes more fully itself as it rises.",

    "Progressing, but turned back. Perseverance brings good fortune. If you meet no confidence, be magnanimous, and no blame. Your advance is blocked; you are turned back. But if you persevere in your own brightness, good fortune comes. Even if others do not yet trust you, be magnanimous—hold no grudge. In time, your light will be seen.",
    "Progressing, but in sorrow. Perseverance brings good fortune. You receive this blessing from your grandmother. Advance brings sorrow—because progress often means leaving something behind. But perseverance brings good fortune. The blessing comes from the grandmother—from tradition, from the feminine, from the deep past. You carry it with you, even as you move forward.",
    "All are in accord. Regret disappears. To advance without confidence from others is hard; when all are in accord, regret dissolves. The line reminds that progress is not solitary; it is communal. When your light is bright enough, others naturally align.",
    "Progressing like a hamster. Perseverance brings danger. To hoard, to advance with greed, to move like a hamster gathering more than it needs—this brings danger. Perseverance in this grasping leads to ruin. Progress must be generous, not grasping.",
    "Regret disappears. Taking gain or loss, do not be concerned. Going forward brings good fortune. Everything furthers. At this stage, you are beyond concern for gain or loss. Your progress is not about what you get; it is about what you become. Going forward now brings good fortune because you are free of attachment. Everything furthers because you are not holding anything back.",
    "Progressing with the horns. Only to attack the city. Misfortune. Perseverance brings danger. No blame. To use your horns—your sharpness, your aggression—to advance is to attack the city, to force your way. This brings misfortune. Perseverance in this mode brings danger. But the line says no blame—perhaps because sometimes you must use the horns, but know that it is not the way of true progress. It is a fallback, not the path."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The great Tao flows everywhere. It can go left or right. All things depend on it for life, and it does not turn away.' Hexagram 35 is this flowing Tao, the sun that rises without effort, the progress that is simply the nature of things. The wise one does not seek to advance; they seek to be bright. And in that brightness, advancement comes of itself."
