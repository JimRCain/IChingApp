  heart: "Water over wood. Wood descends into water, drawing it up. The well is ancient, unchanging, always available. It does not run dry; it does not overflow. It simply waits, offering its water to any who come. The well is the image of character: deep, still, reliable. It does not seek; it does not refuse. It is there, and its presence is gift. In a world of change, the well abides.",

    chinese: "井。改邑不改井，无喪无得，往來井井。汔至，亦未繘井，羸其瓶，凶。",
    rendering: "The Well. The town may change, but the well does not. It neither loses nor gains. They come and go, drawing from the well. If the rope does not reach, or if the jug breaks, misfortune."
  },
  judgment: "The well is the constant in the midst of change. Towns rise and fall; the well remains. It neither loses nor gains by those who draw from it. Its water is always there, always the same. In human life, the well is your deepest character, your essential virtue. It does not change with circumstance; it does not increase with praise or decrease with blame. They come and go, drawing from you—some take, some leave, some break the jug. If the rope does not reach—if you cannot access your own depth—or if the jug breaks—if your vessel is flawed—then misfortune follows. But the well itself is not harmed. It waits, patient, full.",
  image: "Water over wood. The noble one urges the people to work and encourages them in their mutual tasks. Water over wood: wood lowers the bucket, water rises. The noble one learns: urge the people to work—not by commanding, but by providing the means. Encourage them in mutual tasks—the drawing of water is communal; the well serves all. The well does not work; it simply is. The people work, using its gift. The noble one, like the well, provides the resource and encourages the community to use it well.",

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The supreme good is like water. It benefits all things and does not contend. It stays in lowly places that others despise. Thus it is near the Tao.' Hexagram 48 is water in the well—still, deep, available. The well does not contend; it simply offers. It does not seek; it waits. This is the nature of true virtue: to be so completely what you are that others can draw from you without diminishing you."
