  heart: "Thunder and rain. The storm that breaks the drought. Below, thunder stirs; above, rain falls. But between them, clouds still gather, confused, heavy. This is the moment after conception and before birth—the quickening, the first stirring, the struggle to emerge. Everything is here, potential fully present, but not yet delivered. Difficulty at the Beginning is not failure; it is the birth pangs of creation.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "屯。元亨利貞。勿用有攸往。利建侯。",
    rendering: "Difficulty at the Beginning works supreme success, Furthering through perseverance. Do not use this for undertaking. It is favorable to appoint helpers."
  },
  judgment: "The seed has sprouted, but the soil is hard. Do not mistake this struggle for a sign that you are on the wrong path. The beginning of anything real meets resistance—the world does not part easily to let the new in. Supreme success is promised, but not yet. First comes the work of rooting, of pushing against the dark earth. Do not undertake great journeys now. Instead, gather helpers, those who can steady you while you find your footing. The noble one does not go it alone at the beginning.",
  image: "Clouds and thunder. Thus the noble one weaves the fabric of order. Thunder stirs below, clouds gather above, but the rain has not yet fallen. All the elements are present, but not yet resolved. In this tension, the wise one begins to weave—bringing together what is separate, ordering what is chaotic. Not by force, but by patient interconnection. Like a spider spinning its first thread across emptiness, you begin with what you have, trusting the web will hold.",
  lines: [
    "Hesitation and hindrance. It furthers one to remain persevering. It furthers one to appoint helpers. The first step is the hardest. The ground is uncertain, the way unclear. Do not charge forward blindly. Hesitation here is not weakness—it is the wise pause before commitment. Like testing the ice with one foot before trusting it with your whole weight, you wait, you feel, you gather those who can see what you cannot. The hesitation itself, when conscious, becomes part of the path.",
    "Difficulties pile up. Horse and wagon part. Not a robber, but a suitor. The maiden is chaste, she does not pledge herself. Ten years, then she pledges. Things fall apart—the horse leaves the wagon, what was joined now separates. But this is not disaster; it is the natural sorting of what does not belong together. Wait, like the maiden who will not give herself to the wrong one. Even if it takes ten years, the right alignment will come. Do not force what is not ready to join.",
    "Whoever hunts deer without the forester only enters the thicket. The noble one understands the signs of the times. It is better to give up than to continue. To pursue something without the proper guide, without understanding the territory, is to lose yourself in the thicket. The forester knows the land, knows the habits of the deer. If you hunt without them, you will stumble in blindness. There are times when giving up is not failure—it is the wisdom of recognizing you are not ready. The noble one reads the signs and knows when to wait.",
    "Horse and wagon part. Seek union. To go brings good fortune. Everything acts favorably. After the separation, the seeking. The horse that left now returns, or a new horse appears. The scattering was not permanent—it was the clearing of space for a truer joining. Now you can seek, and the seeking itself is blessed. The movement that was forbidden in the first line is now possible, because the ground has been tested, the helpers gathered, the timing matured. Go now.",
    "Difficulties in blessing. A little perseverance brings good fortune. Great perseverance brings misfortune. A small kindness offered at the right moment waters the struggling sprout. But to pour a flood on it, to try to force growth with great effort, drowns it. You are being blessed, but the blessing comes drop by drop. Accept the little that is given. Do not demand the full abundance before the plant can hold it. Patience in receiving is as important as patience in striving.",
    "Horse and wagon part. Bloody tears flow. When the breaking is final, when separation is complete, there is grief. Bloody tears—the kind that come from the deepest place. This line does not console; it witnesses. Some difficulties end not in union but in loss. And yet, even this has its place in the great turning. The tears themselves water something new, somewhere, in another season. Let them flow."

    description: "Thunder below, rain above. The stirring and the potential, but not yet the release. Thunder shakes the earth, rain gathers in clouds, but the downpour has not come. This is the moment of highest tension before creation breaks through. The thunder is your inner impulse to act; the water is the outer situation still forming. Both are real. Both are waiting."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The Tao gives birth to one. One gives birth to two. Two gives birth to three. Three gives birth to ten thousand things.' Hexagram 3 is the three—the firstborn of Heaven and Earth, the beginning of the ten thousand things. And what is birth but difficulty? The Tao does not promise easy beginnings. It promises that beginnings are possible, that even the hardest soil will yield if the seed is true. The sprout does not fight the earth; it grows through it, using the pressure to strengthen itself. Your difficulties at the beginning are not obstacles to your path—they are the path. The rain will fall when the clouds are full enough. The thunder has already sounded."
