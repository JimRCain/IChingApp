  heart: "Fire over lake. Fire rises, lake sinks. They move apart, each following its nature, yet they are part of the same landscape. Opposition is not enmity; it is the natural divergence of things that are different. The fire and the lake cannot be the same, but they can coexist, each enriching the whole in its own way. In human life, opposition arises when two people, two groups, two truths seem irreconcilable. But opposition, rightly understood, is not the end of relationship; it is the beginning of a larger understanding.",

    chinese: "睽。小事吉。",
    rendering: "Opposition. In small matters, good fortune."

  judgment: "When fire rises and water sinks, they seem opposed. But they are still part of one world. In opposition, do not seek to force union; seek to understand difference. In small matters, good fortune—because small differences can be bridged, small conflicts resolved. Great matters may wait. The wise one in times of opposition does not try to make everything one; they let each thing be what it is, and find the hidden connection that underlies all difference. The fire and the lake are both necessary; the world needs both rising and sinking.",
  image: "Fire over lake. The noble one finds common ground in difference. Fire over lake: they move apart, yet they are part of the same view. The noble one learns: in opposition, do not focus on what divides; find the common ground that underlies all difference. Even enemies share the same sky. In that shared sky, connection is possible. The noble one seeks this common ground, not to erase difference, but to make relationship possible despite it.",

    "Regret disappears. If you lose your horse, do not pursue it. It will return of itself. See the bad person, and avoid blame. In opposition, first loss—the horse runs away. Do not chase; it will return. And when you encounter the bad person—the one who opposes you—do not engage. Avoid blame by not entering their field. Wait, and the horse returns.",
    "Meeting your lord in a narrow lane. No blame. In opposition, meetings are unexpected, in narrow places. But they happen. If you meet your lord—the one you should follow—in such a constrained way, there is no blame. Even narrow lanes can lead to connection.",
    "You see the wagon dragged back, the oxen halted, the man with the burned hair and the slashed nose. Not a good beginning, but a good end. Opposition at its most visible: everything blocked, everyone hurt. The beginning is not good. But the line insists: a good end is possible. Persevere through the ugliness.",
    "Isolated through opposition, you meet a like-minded man. With him you can work. Danger, but no blame. Isolation is the fruit of opposition. But in that isolation, you meet one who shares your mind. With that one, you can work. Danger remains—you are still opposed by the world—but no blame because you have found your ally.",
    "Regret disappears. The companion bites through the wrappings. If you go to him, how could it be a blame? The companion—the one who shares your mind—breaks through what separates you. The wrappings, the veils, the misunderstandings. If you go to him now, there is no blame. The connection is real, and it overcomes opposition.",
    "Isolated through opposition, you see a pig covered with dirt, a wagon full of ghosts. First you draw your bow, then you lay it aside. Not a robber, but a suitor. If you go, rain comes. Good fortune. The final line: opposition at its most bizarre—seeing ghosts, monsters, threats. You prepare to fight. Then you see clearly: not a robber, but a suitor. You lay down the bow. If you go forward, rain comes—cleansing, resolution. Good fortune follows because you saw through the illusion."

    description: "Lake below, fire above. Fire rises, lake sinks—they move apart. This is opposition: the natural divergence of different natures. Yet they are part of the same world, the same landscape. The fire and the lake both have their place. In opposition, honor the difference, and find the hidden unity."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The heavy is the root of the light. The still is the master of the restless.' Hexagram 38 is the light and the restless in opposition to the heavy and the still. But opposition is not ultimate. The heavy and light, still and restless—they are two poles of one Tao. The wise one does not take sides; they stand in the center and see both. From that center, even opposites can meet."
