  heart: "Mountain above, fire below. The fire illuminates the mountain, making it beautiful. This is grace: not the superficial adornment that hides, but the inner light that reveals. The mountain does not need the fire to be a mountain, but the fire makes its beauty visible. Grace is this visibility: the form illuminated by the essence, the outer shaped by the inner. True grace is not added; it is revealed.",

  judgment: "Grace has success. In small matters it is favorable to undertake something. Grace brings success, but it is not the foundation of great undertakings. It is favorable for small matters—for beautifying, for refining, for making what is already good more visible. Do not mistake grace for substance. The fire illuminates the mountain, but it does not make the mountain. In small matters, grace furthers. In great matters, substance is required.",
  image: "Fire at the foot of the mountain. The image of Grace. The noble one proceeds in this way when clarifying current affairs, but does not dare to decide controversial issues in this way. Fire at the foot of the mountain: the light that reveals the form. The noble one learns from this: to clarify current affairs with grace, to make things clear and beautiful. But they do not dare to decide controversial issues with grace alone. For that, substance is needed. Grace clarifies; it does not resolve.",

    "He lends grace to his toes, leaves the carriage, and walks. You lend grace to the small things—to the toes, the foundation of movement. You leave the carriage—the easy way—and walk. This is grace in action: not the ornament that covers, but the choice that reveals. You walk because walking is more true than riding. The grace is in the truth, not the appearance.",
    "Lends grace to the beard on his chin. The grace is on the beard—the ornament, the decoration. This is grace as adornment. It is not wrong, but it is superficial. The beard does not move the body; it follows. Grace at this level is pleasant, but it is not transformative. It decorates; it does not change.",
    "Graceful and moist. Constant perseverance brings good fortune. The grace is graceful and moist—alive, flowing, not dry ornament. This grace, if persevered in constantly, brings good fortune. It is not the surface grace that fades, but the deep grace that sustains. Like water that nourishes, not paint that covers. Persevere in this grace, and good fortune follows.",
    "Grace or simplicity? A white horse comes as if on wings. He is not a robber, he will woo at the right time. You face a choice: grace or simplicity? The white horse comes—pure, unadorned, swift. He is not a robber; he will woo at the right time. This is the grace of simplicity: the white horse that needs no decoration. When grace and simplicity unite, there is no conflict. The wooing happens at the right time, naturally.",
    "Grace in the hills and gardens. The roll of silk is meager and small. Humiliation, but in the end there is good fortune. The grace is in the hills and gardens—in nature, in the unforced. The roll of silk is meager and small—the offering is modest. There may be humiliation in this modesty, but in the end there is good fortune. The grace of nature, the grace of simplicity, the grace of small offerings—these endure. The grand grace fades; the simple grace remains.",
    "Simple grace. No blame. At the peak, grace returns to simplicity. No ornament, no adornment, just the thing itself, beautifully itself. This is simple grace. No blame follows because you have not deceived. You have not covered; you have revealed. The mountain is a mountain. The fire is fire. And in their meeting, grace happens without effort."

    description: "Fire below, mountain above. The fire illuminates the mountain from below, revealing its contours, its beauty, its form. This is grace: the light that makes visible what is already there. The mountain does not become something else; it becomes more itself. The fire does not change the mountain; it reveals it. Together, they create the beauty that is grace."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'When the people see beauty, they conceive of ugliness. When they see good, they conceive of evil.' Hexagram 22 knows this danger: grace can become the ornament that hides, the beauty that creates its opposite. But true grace—the grace of the white horse, the grace of the hills and gardens, the simple grace—this grace does not create ugliness because it does not claim to be more than it is. The fire does not claim to be the mountain; it only reveals it. The mountain does not claim to be more than a mountain; it only is. In your own grace, find this same honesty. Do not adorn to hide; reveal to show. Do not beautify to deceive; illuminate to clarify. Simple grace has no opposite. It just is."
