  heart: "Lake over earth. The lake gathers water, the earth receives it. Gathering Together is the drawing together of what belongs together—not by force, but by affinity. People gather around a common purpose, a shared vision, a beloved leader. Not because they are commanded, but because they recognize in the gathering a deeper home. The lake does not command the streams; they flow to it because it is low. So too, the wise leader is low, and all things flow to them.",

    chinese: "萃。亨。王假有廟。利見大人，亨，利貞。用大牲吉。利有攸往。",
    rendering: "Gathering Together. Success. The king approaches his temple. It furthers to see the great person. Success. Perseverance furthers. To offer great sacrifice brings good fortune. It furthers to undertake something."
  },
  judgment: "When like gathers like, success follows naturally. The king approaches his temple—the place of meeting, of worship, of common purpose. It furthers to see the great person—one who embodies the vision, who can guide the gathering. Perseverance in this seeing furthers all things. To offer great sacrifice—to give generously to the common purpose—brings good fortune because it strengthens the bond. It furthers to undertake something—action now, from the gathered strength, will bear fruit. The gathering is not an end; it is the beginning of what can only be done together.",
  image: "Lake over earth. The noble one prepares weapons to meet the unforeseen. Lake over earth: water gathers, but what if the banks break? The noble one prepares—not from fear, but from wisdom. Gathering brings strength, but also vulnerability. Prepare weapons—not to attack, but to defend against the unforeseen. The noble one knows that even in harmony, the world can intrude. Be ready, not paranoid; prepared, not preemptively armed.",

    "If you are sincere but not to the end, there will be confusion. Then you gather them again. One cry, and you laugh. Do not worry. Going forward is without blame.",
    "Letting oneself be drawn brings good fortune. No blame. If you are sincere, it furthers to bring even a small offering.",
    "Gathering together brings sighs. Nothing that would further. Going forward is without blame. Slight humiliation.",
    "Great good fortune. No blame.",
    "If in gathering together one has position, there is no blame. If there are some who are not yet sincere, be magnanimous and persevere. Then regret disappears.",
    "Lamenting and sighing, floods of tears. But no blame."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The highest good is like water. Water benefits all things and does not contend. It stays in lowly places that others despise. Thus it is near the Tao.' Hexagram 45 is water gathering in the low places—the people gathering around the leader who is humble. The wise leader does not seek followers; they become a valley, and the followers come of themselves."
