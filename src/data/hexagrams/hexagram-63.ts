  heart: "Water over fire. The fire has heated the water; the water has tempered the fire. Their work is done; balance is achieved. After Completion is the moment of success, of fulfillment, of harmony. But the hexagram warns: this moment is also the beginning of decline. The fire will dim, the water will cool. After completion, the wise one does not rest on achievement; they prepare for what comes next. The crossing is complete, but the river still flows.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "既濟。亨小，利貞。初吉終亂。",
    rendering: "After Completion. Success in small matters. Perseverance furthers. At the beginning, good fortune; at the end, disorder."
  },
  judgment: "After completion, success is in small matters—maintaining, adjusting, fine-tuning. Perseverance in this careful tending furthers. At the beginning, good fortune; at the end, disorder. This is the law of all achievement: what is made will unmake; what is completed will be undone. The wise one does not despair at this; they accept it as natural. They enjoy the completion while it lasts, and they prepare for the inevitable change. The fire and water have done their work; now they rest. You too, after completion, rest—but stay awake.",
  image: "Water over fire. The noble one takes thought of misfortune and arms himself against it in advance. Water over fire: balance achieved, but the water may quench the fire, the fire may boil the water. The noble one learns: think of misfortune. Arm against it in advance. Not from fear, but from wisdom. After completion, the seeds of disorder are already present. The wise one sees them and prepares. Not to prevent the inevitable, but to meet it with grace.",

    "He brakes his wheels. He gets his tail in the water. No blame. The first step after completion: slow down. Brake the wheels. The tail gets wet—a small consequence, not fatal. No blame because you are cautious. Completion is not a time for speed.",
    "The woman loses her curtain. Do not go in pursuit. In seven days you will get it back. After completion, small losses occur. The curtain—privacy, modesty—is lost. Do not chase it. In seven days—a full cycle—it will return. Patience restores what is truly yours.",
    "The high ancestor attacks the demon region. After three years, he subdues it. Inferior people should not be employed. Great tasks after completion take time—three years to subdue the demon. The warning: inferior people—those who would exploit the success—should not be employed. Completion is vulnerable to corruption. Guard it with good people.",
    "The finest cloth may become rags. Be careful all day long. The finest things decay. Completion is not permanent. Be careful all day long—attention, not anxiety. Watch for the signs of decay, and tend them early.",
    "The neighbor in the east who slaughters an ox does not attain as much blessing as the neighbor in the west with his small offering. In after completion, small sincerity outdoes large ritual. The east slaughters an ox—great sacrifice, but perhaps performed without heart. The west offers a small gift, but with true feeling. He attains blessing. After completion, quality matters more than quantity.",
    "He gets his head in the water. Danger. The final immersion: head in water, the completion overwhelmed. Danger because the balance is lost. The line does not offer hope; it simply records. After completion, there is also after. The cycle continues."

    description: "Fire below, water above. The water and fire have found balance—neither overcomes the other. This is after completion: the moment of perfect harmony. But the hexagram's position—63 of 64—reminds us that after completion comes dissolution. The fire will dim, the water will cool. Enjoy the harmony, but do not cling."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name.' Hexagram 63 is the completion that can be completed—and therefore, it is not eternal. After completion, there is always another hexagram. The sage does not seek permanent success; they seek right action in each moment. The fire and water will separate; that is their nature. But for now, they are in balance. Be grateful, be careful, and let the next moment come."
