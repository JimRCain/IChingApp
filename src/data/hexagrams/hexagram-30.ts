  heart: "Fire above, fire below. The flame that clings to what feeds it. This is clarity—not the cold clarity of the detached, but the warm clarity of the engaged. Fire does not burn alone; it clings to the wood, the oil, the fuel. It gives light by consuming. It gives warmth by transforming. This is the nature of clarity: to see by burning, to illuminate by consuming.",

  judgment: "The Clinging. Perseverance furthers. It brings success. Care of the cow brings good fortune. Fire clings to what feeds it. This is the nature of clarity: it requires fuel. Perseverance furthers—the fire must be tended. It brings success—the light illuminates the way. Care of the cow brings good fortune—the cow is gentle, yielding, nourishing. Tend your fire with gentleness. Do not force it. Feed it. Care for it. Good fortune follows.",
  image: "That which is bright rises twice. The image of Fire. Thus the great person, by perpetuating this brightness, illuminates the four quarters of the world. Fire rises—bright, clear, illuminating. It rises twice: once in the lower trigram, once in the upper. The great person learns from this: to perpetuate brightness, to illuminate the four quarters. Not once, but repeatedly. Not for themselves, but for the world. This is the nature of fire: to give light by giving itself.",

The confusion is not failure. It is the nature of beginning. Be serious. Be intent. The path will clear.",
    "Yellow light. Supreme good fortune. The light is yellow—the color of the center, of balance, of earth. This is supreme good fortune. The fire is not too hot, not too cold. It is just right. It is centered. This is the light that illuminates without burning. This is the clarity that sees without judging.",
    "In the light of the setting sun, people either beat the pot and sing or loudly bewail the approach of old age. Misfortune. The sun sets. The light fades. People either beat the pot and sing—they celebrate what was—or they bewail the approach of old age. They mourn what is ending. This brings misfortune. Neither celebration nor mourning is the way. The light is the light. Accept it. Let it be.",
    "Suddenly it comes like a flame, like a fire, like a lightning bolt. It is not accepted. Misfortune. Suddenly, the fire comes—flame, fire, lightning. It is too much. It is not accepted. This brings misfortune. The fire that comes too suddenly burns without illuminating. The clarity that comes too fast blinds instead of reveals. Wait. Let the fire build gradually.",
    "In tears, flooding and sighing. Good fortune. The tears flood. The sighs come. This is the fire that burns through grief. This brings good fortune because the fire is real. It is not suppressed. It is not hidden. It burns. And in burning, it transforms. The tears are the fuel. The sighs are the smoke. The fire is the transformation.",
    "The king uses them to march forth and chastise. Then it is best to kill the leaders and take captive the followers. No blame. The king uses the fire to march forth—to chastise, to correct. It is best to kill the leaders and take captive the followers. This is the fire that purifies. It removes what leads astray. It captures what can be corrected. No blame follows because the fire is just. It is not cruel. It is clear."

    description: "Fire above, fire below. The flame that clings, the brightness that illuminates. Fire does not burn alone; it clings to what feeds it. This is the nature of clarity: it requires fuel, it requires engagement. The fire that is detached goes out. The fire that clings burns bright. This is the teaching of the clinging: to illuminate, you must engage. To see clearly, you must be involved."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'Those who know do not speak. Those who speak do not know.' Hexagram 30 is the paradox of fire: it gives light by consuming, it illuminates by burning. The sage knows this: clarity comes from engagement, not detachment. The fire that clings is the fire that illuminates. In your own life, do not seek the cold clarity of the detached. Seek the warm clarity of the engaged. Burn. Illuminate. Give light by giving yourself. This is the way of fire. This is the way of wisdom."
