  heart: "Thunder in heaven. The sound rolls across the sky, unstoppable, immense. Great power is not the power to dominate, but the power to move without obstruction. The thunder does not need to fight the clouds; it simply sounds, and the clouds part. True power is effortless because it is aligned. When you have great power, you do not need to prove it. It proves itself by its presence, like the sky that holds the thunder without trembling.",

    chinese: "大壮。利貞。",
    rendering: "Great Power. Perseverance furthers."

  judgment: "Great power is not for conquest; it is for expression. When power is truly great, it does not need to assert itself; it simply is. Perseverance in this quiet greatness furthers all things. Do not use your power to dominate; use it to create, to move, to clear away obstacles. The thunder does not command the sky; it fills it. Your power, rightly held, fills your world without needing to force. Persevere in this right use, and nothing can stop you.",
  image: "Thunder in heaven. The noble one does not tread where there is no order. Thunder in heaven: the sound is immense, but it comes in its own time, following the order of the sky. The noble one learns: do not tread where there is no order. Do not apply your power where it cannot be received. Wait for the right context, the right moment. Power used in chaos creates more chaos. Power used in order creates more order.",
  lines: [
    "Power in the toes. To go forward brings misfortune. The toes—the smallest movement. To use power here, at the first stirring, before you have any ground, brings misfortune. Wait until you are more firmly placed.",
    "Perseverance brings good fortune. The power is real, but it must be held rightly. Perseverance in this right holding brings good fortune. Not yet action, just the steady presence of power, waiting.",
    "The common person uses power. The noble person does not. To use power aggressively, to push and shove—this is the way of the common person. The noble one knows that true power does not need to be used; it simply is. To use it is to diminish it.",
    "Perseverance brings good fortune. Regret disappears. The hedge opens; there is no entanglement. Power now finds its way. The hedge that blocked you opens; the entanglements dissolve. Perseverance in the right holding has prepared you, and now you can move without regret.",
    "Loses the goat with ease. No regret. The goat butts, pushes, insists. To lose the goat—to let go of the need to push, to insist—is to gain true power. No regret because you have given up nothing real; you have only shed what was false.",
    "The goat butts against the hedge. It cannot go back, it cannot go forward. Nothing furthers. If you persist in pushing, insisting, you will find yourself stuck—cannot go back, cannot go forward. The hedge holds you. Nothing furthers now because you refused to let go of the goat. When power is used wrongly, it traps you."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'To know the masculine and keep to the feminine is to be the valley of the world.' Hexagram 34 is the masculine known and held. Great power is not the power that asserts; it is the power that is so complete it does not need to assert. Like the valley that contains all streams, it simply is, and everything flows to it. The noble one does not use power; they embody it, and in that embodiment, the world is moved."
