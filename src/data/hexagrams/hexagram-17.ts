  heart: "Lake above, thunder below. The thunder stirs in the depths; the lake receives it on the surface. This is following: not the blind obedience of the weak, but the conscious choice of the wise. The lake does not resist the thunder; it reflects it, amplifies it, carries it outward. To follow well is to be like the lake: open, responsive, carrying forward what is worthy of being carried.",

    chinese: "隨。元亨利貞，无咎。",
    rendering: "Following has supreme success. Perseverance furthers. No blame."

  judgment: "Following has supreme success. Perseverance furthers. No blame. There is a time to lead and a time to follow. This is the time to follow. But not blindly. Follow what is true, what is good, what is in accord with the movement of the whole. When you follow with discernment, when you persevere in what is worthy, there is no blame. Supreme success follows because you are aligned with the current, not fighting it.",
  image: "Thunder in the middle of the lake. The image of Following. The noble one at nightfall goes indoors for rest and recuperation. Thunder in the lake: the stirring is contained, held, not scattered. The noble one learns from this: there is a time for movement and a time for rest. At nightfall, they go indoors. They do not fight the natural rhythm. They follow it. This is the highest following: to follow the Tao itself, the rhythm of rest and activity, of movement and stillness.",

    "The standard is changing. Perseverance brings good fortune. To go outside the door in company produces deeds. The standard—the measure, the guide—is changing. Do not resist this change; align with it. Perseverance in this alignment brings good fortune. And when you go outside the door in company—with others who also follow the new standard—you create deeds. Not alone, but together. Not resisting, but following.",
    "If one clings to the little boy, one loses the strong man. Clinging to what is immature, what is not yet ready, you lose the strong man—the capable, the mature, the ready. This is the danger of following the wrong thing. Choose wisely what you follow. The little boy may be endearing, but the strong man can carry the work.",
    "If one clings to the strong man, one loses the little boy. Through following one finds what one seeks. Furtherance in persevering. The reverse is also true. If you cling to the strong man, you lose the little boy. You cannot have both. Choose. And know that through following—true following—you find what you seek. Not by grasping, but by aligning. Furtherance comes to those who persevere in this choice.",
    "Following creates success. Perseverance brings misfortune. To go one's way with sincerity brings clarity. How could there be blame in this? Following creates success—but only if what you follow is true. If you persevere in following what is false, misfortune comes. Instead, go your way with sincerity. Follow your own truth. This brings clarity. And how could there be blame in being true?",
    "Sincere in the good. Good fortune. Your sincerity is directed toward the good—not toward gain, not toward advantage, but toward what is genuinely good. This sincerity brings good fortune because it aligns you with the deepest current. You are not following a person or a idea; you are following the good itself. This cannot fail.",
    "He meets with firm allegiance and is still further bound. The king introduces him to the Western Mountain. At the peak of following, you meet with firm allegiance. Others follow you because you have followed well. You are bound further—not by chains, but by commitment. And the king—the highest authority—introduces you to the Western Mountain, the place of rest, of completion. This is the reward of true following: you become worthy of being followed, and you are led to the place of rest."

    description: "Thunder below, lake above. The thunder stirs in the depths; the lake reflects it on the surface. This is following: the inner movement meeting the outer receptivity. The lake does not create the thunder; it receives it. The thunder does not command the lake; it simply sounds. Together, they create the resonance that is following. Not command and obedience, but movement and response."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The ten thousand things arise, and I watch their return. Each thing flourishes, then returns to its root. Returning to the root is stillness. Stillness is returning to the Tao.' Hexagram 17 is the art of watching, of following the return. The sage does not push the ten thousand things; they watch them flourish and return. In your own following, find this same watchfulness. Do not force; do not resist. Follow the movement, and you will find the stillness at its center. Follow the flourishing, and you will find the root. This is the highest following: to follow the Tao itself, which follows nothing, yet is followed by all."
