  heart: "Mountain above, lake below. The mountain rests, the lake reflects—but the lake is diminished, its waters drawn off to moisten the mountain. Decrease is not loss; it is redistribution. What is taken from one is given to another, and the whole is served. The noble one accepts decrease not as deprivation but as participation in a larger economy. When you lose something, ask not only what you have lost, but what has been made possible by your loss.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "損。有孚，元吉，无咎，可貞，利有攸往。曷之用？二簋可用享。",
    rendering: "Decrease. If you are sincere, there is supreme good fortune, no blame, perseverance that furthers. It furthers one to undertake something. How is this used? Two bowls may be used for the offering."
  },
  judgment: "Decrease, rightly understood, is not a subtraction but a transformation. When you are sincere—when you give without resentment, lose without clinging—supreme good fortune follows. No blame attaches to such decrease because it is not waste; it is offering. Perseverance in this attitude furthers all things. It furthers one to undertake something—even in decrease, action is possible. The offering need not be grand; two simple bowls suffice. The gods care not for quantity but for quality of heart. In decrease, simplify, offer what you have, and trust that the economy of the Tao is just.",
  image: "Mountain above lake. The noble one curbs anger and restrains desires. Mountain above lake: the lake's waters are drawn up to nourish the mountain. The noble one sees this and learns: curb anger—it depletes you and others without nourishing. Restrain desires—they take without giving back. Decrease is not about losing what you need; it is about releasing what harms. The lake does not miss the water that rises; it becomes part of the mountain's life.",

    "Going quickly when one's work is done brings no blame. But one must consider how much to decrease. When the task is finished, do not linger. Decrease your attachment to the work, and go. But consider: how much to decrease? Not everything—just enough to stay light.",
    "Perseverance furthers. To undertake something brings misfortune. Without decreasing oneself, one can increase others. In decrease, perseverance in the right attitude furthers. But to undertake something new now—to reach for more—brings misfortune. Instead, without decreasing yourself—without losing your own center—you can increase others. Give from your surplus, not your substance.",
    "When three go together, they decrease one. When one goes alone, he finds a friend. Three together: alliances, factions, the politics of decrease. One may be left out. But when one goes alone, unattached, he finds a true friend—not in numbers, but in depth. In decrease, solitude can be gift.",
    "If you decrease your illness, it furthers to act quickly. Good fortune. No blame. Illness—any affliction—can be decreased if you act at the right time. Quick action, when the cause is clear, brings good fortune. No blame because you are not harming; you are healing.",
    "Someone increases you. Ten pairs of turtles cannot refuse. Supreme good fortune. After decrease, increase comes—not from your effort, but as gift. Ten pairs of turtles—ancient instruments of divination, symbols of certainty—cannot refuse this increase. It is fated, natural. Supreme good fortune follows because you accepted decrease without resentment.",
    "If you increase others, no one opposes you. Perseverance brings good fortune. It furthers to have somewhere to go. You gain helpers without a household. The final stage: you have learned decrease so well that you now increase others. No one opposes such generosity. Perseverance in this brings good fortune. It furthers to have somewhere to go—a purpose, a direction. And you gain helpers, not through seeking, but through being the kind of person who naturally attracts them."

    description: "Lake below, mountain above. The lake's waters rise to nourish the mountain. This is decrease: giving of oneself so that another may flourish. The lake does not begrudge the loss; it becomes part of a larger wholeness."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The sage does not accumulate. The more he helps others, the more he possesses. The more he gives to others, the more he gains.' Hexagram 41 is the art of this sacred accumulation through decrease. When you give, you are not diminished; you are redistributed. The lake becomes the mountain; the mountain becomes the lake. In the economy of the Tao, loss is always gain, and decrease always increase."
