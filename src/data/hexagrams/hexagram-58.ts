  heart: "Lake over lake. Water reflecting water, joy upon joy. The Joyous is the power of authentic happiness—not the fleeting pleasure of acquisition, but the deep joy of connection, of presence, of being fully alive. True joy is contagious; it spreads like ripples on a lake. The wise one does not seek joy; they become a source of it, and others are refreshed.",

    chinese: "兌。亨，利貞。",
    rendering: "The Joyous. Success. Perseverance furthers."
  },
  judgment: "Joy succeeds because it opens hearts. When you are genuinely joyful, others are drawn to you, and together you create more joy. Perseverance in this authentic happiness furthers all things. But beware: joy can be counterfeited. Flattery, empty cheer, forced smiles—these are not the Joyous; they are its shadow. True joy is rooted in sincerity, in the deep satisfaction of being alive and connected. Cultivate that root, and the fruit will be sweet.",
  image: "Lakes resting one on another. The noble one discusses things with friends. Lakes together: they reflect each other, deepen each other. The noble one learns: discuss things with friends. Joy is amplified in companionship. Not shallow chatter, but deep exchange—the meeting of minds and hearts. In such discussion, joy is born and nourished.",
  lines: [
    "Joy that is inward and quiet. Good fortune. The first joy: inward, quiet, not dependent on others. This is the root of all true happiness. Good fortune because it cannot be taken away.",
    "Joy that is sincere. Good fortune. Regret disappears. Sincere joy, expressed genuinely, brings good fortune. Regret disappears because you are not pretending. Your joy is real, and the world receives it.",
    "Joy that comes from outside. Misfortune. Joy dependent on externals—on praise, on possessions, on events—brings misfortune because it cannot last. When the outside changes, the joy vanishes. Do not build your happiness on sand.",
    "Joy that is not yet decided. The boundary is in motion. There is no rest. If you are sincere, danger will leave. Joy that wavers, that cannot settle. The boundary moves; there is no rest. But if you are sincere—if you stay true to your deepest self—danger will leave. The wavering joy finds its center.",
    "Joy in what is genuine. Danger. But perseverance in what is right brings good fortune. To find joy in what is genuine is right, but it may bring danger because the world often fears the real. Persevere in this right joy, and good fortune follows.",
    "Joy that is seductive and leads others on. The joy that uses others, that manipulates, that seduces—this is the corruption of the Joyous. It may work for a time, but in the end, it brings misfortune. True joy never uses; it shares."

    description: "Lake over lake. Joy reflecting joy. The lakes mirror each other, their depths multiplying. This is the Joyous: not a single happiness, but happiness shared, reflected, amplified. In true joy, there is no taking; there is only giving and receiving, like lakes exchanging their reflections."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'I have three treasures that I hold and keep. The first is compassion. The second is frugality. The third is not daring to be ahead of the world.' Hexagram 58 is the treasure of compassion made manifest. True joy is compassionate; it does not seek its own at the expense of others. It is frugal; it does not need excess to be happy. It does not dare to be ahead; it is content to be with. In this, it is like the lake: deep, still, reflecting all, asking nothing."
