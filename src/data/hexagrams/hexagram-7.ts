  heart: "Water flowing underground. Hidden, unseen, but moving with purpose. Above, the earth; below, the stream that nourishes it. This is the army—not the visible force, but the disciplined structure that supports from beneath. The army is not war; it is organization. It is the capacity to act together, to move as one, to bring order out of chaos. The true leader does not stand above, waving banners. They flow underground, unseen, making the earth fertile.",
  judgment: "There are times when collective action is necessary. Not for conquest, not for glory—but for protection, for order, for the survival of what matters. In such times, the leader must be like the old man: experienced, calm, without personal ambition. They do not seek the army; the army seeks them. They lead not because they want power, but because they know how to serve. Perseverance here means staying true to the purpose, not getting drunk on the power. If the leader remains a channel, not a source, there is good fortune and no blame.",
  image: "Water flows underground. The noble one nurtures the people with generosity and protects them from harm. Water underground is invisible, but without it, the earth would be barren. The noble one, like this hidden water, nurtures without showing. They are generous—not with display, but with steady, reliable support. They protect—not with force visible, but with structure that holds. The army at its best is not seen; it is felt in the order it maintains, the safety it provides, the fields it allows to be planted in peace.",

    "The army goes forth in proper order. If not, misfortune threatens. The first movement must be correct. Every step, every command, every soldier must know their place. Discipline is not punishment—it is the shared understanding that allows many to act as one. If the order is not proper, if there is confusion or favoritism, misfortune follows not as judgment but as consequence. The army that marches in chaos defeats itself before it meets any enemy.",
    "In the midst of the army, good fortune. No blame. The king bestows a triple commendation. The leader is not above the army; they are in its midst. They do not command from a distance, safe and separate. They are present, sharing the conditions, bearing the same risks. This presence is itself good fortune—the army feels it, trusts it. The king bestows triple commendation not because the leader sought it, but because true leadership, when witnessed, naturally calls forth honor. The leader accepts it without grasping.",
    "The army may carry corpses in the wagon. Misfortune. When the leader is weak, when they try to command without capacity, the army carries corpses—dead weight, useless orders, hollow authority. The wagon, meant for supplies, becomes a hearse. This is misfortune not because the enemy is strong, but because the leader is not. Better to have no army than an army led by one who cannot lead.",
    "The army retreats. No blame. There is no shame in knowing when advance is not possible. The army that retreats in good order, preserving its strength, its cohesion, its purpose, commits no fault. The blame is not in the movement but in the motivation. If retreat is strategy, it is wisdom. If retreat is fear disguised, it will show. The line does not judge; it observes. The wise commander knows the difference.",
    "There is game in the fields. It furthers one to capture them. No blame. The eldest son leads the army. The younger piles up corpses. Perseverance brings misfortune. When the purpose is clear—game in the fields, sustenance for the people—it is right to act. The eldest son, the capable one, leads. But if the younger, the unprepared, tries to take charge, they pile up corpses—waste, failure, unnecessary death. To persevere in this error brings misfortune. Know who should lead. Let them lead.",
    "The great ruler issues commands, founds states, invests families. Inferior people should not be employed. After the work is done, after the army has served its purpose, the great ruler returns to the ways of peace. They found states, not garrisons. They invest families, not soldiers. They issue commands for life, not death. And in all this, they remember: inferior people—those who love war, who seek power, who would make the army their career—should not be employed. The army exists to make itself unnecessary. The leader who forgets this becomes the very thing they were meant to oppose."
