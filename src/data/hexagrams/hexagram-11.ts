  heart: "Heaven and earth in union. The sky above, the earth below, and between them, all things flourish. Not because the sky conquers the earth, not because the earth resists the sky—but because they meet, they exchange, they give to each other. Heaven's light descends, earth's warmth rises. In their meeting, life happens. This is peace: not the absence of movement, but the perfect harmony of all movements. The small departs, the great approaches. Everything is in its right place, flowing as it should.",

    chinese: "泰。小往大來，吉亨。",
    rendering: "Peace. The small departs, the great approaches. Good fortune. Success."

  judgment: "The small departs—the petty, the fearful, the constricted. The great approaches—the expansive, the generous, the true. This is the movement of peace. Not something you force, but something you allow. Heaven and earth are already in union; your task is to align with them. When you do, good fortune follows not as reward, but as nature. Success comes not because you struggled, but because you stopped struggling and let the great approach. In this time of peace, do not grasp. Do not push. Receive. Give. Let the flow carry you. The small will continue to depart; the great will continue to approach. This is the rhythm of peace.",
  image: "Heaven and earth in union. The ruler gives, the people receive. Heaven and earth meet: the sky sends down rain, the earth sends up vapor. They exchange, they mingle, they create. The wise ruler looks at this image and understands: ruling is not taking; it is giving. They give wealth to the people, and the people receive it. They give trust, and the people return it. They give space, and the people fill it with life. This is the economy of peace: the more you give, the more there is. The more you receive, the more you can give. Heaven and earth do not hoard; they exchange. So does the wise one.",

    "When you pull up rushes, other stalks come with them. Setting forth brings good fortune. Pull one rush, and the whole clump comes with it. This is the nature of peace: everything is connected. When you set forth on the right path, you do not go alone. Others are drawn with you—not by force, but by the natural pull of alignment. Your setting forth itself brings good fortune because it moves not just you, but the whole field. In peace, no one walks alone.",
    "Embrace the river reeds. Let them grow. Do not cut them down. In the time of peace, the small things are allowed to grow. The river reeds—humble, ordinary, overlooked—are embraced. They need not become oaks; they are perfect as reeds. This is the wisdom of peace: not everything must be great. Not everything must be useful. Some things are simply allowed to be what they are. Embrace them, and let them grow. In their growing, they contribute to the peace.",
    "No plain without a slope, no going without a return. In hardship, persevere and find no blame. Do not mourn this truth; it is not failure, it is nature. Even in peace, there is no plain without a slope. No going that does not eventually return. The cycle continues—heaven and earth never stop their dance. When hardship comes, as it will, persevere. Not by fighting, but by remembering: the slope is part of the plain. The return is part of the going. In this remembering, there is no blame. Peace includes its own passing.",
    "Fluttering, fluttering. Not rich, you neighbor. Not warned, you trust. The image is of a bird fluttering, restless, unsettled. You are not rich—not in resources, not in virtue—yet you ignore your neighbor's example. You are not warned, yet you trust your own judgment anyway. This is the danger in peace: complacency. Because all is well, you stop learning, stop watching, stop heeding. The fluttering bird thinks it flies, but it only flutters. In peace, stay grounded. Stay teachable.",
    "The sovereign gives his daughter in marriage. Such blessing brings supreme good fortune. In peace, even the highest gives to the lowest. The sovereign's daughter marries into a humble family—not a loss of status, but a completion of the whole. This is the blessing of peace: that what is above flows down, and what is below rises up, and in their meeting, both are blessed. Supreme good fortune follows not because the match is advantageous, but because it is true.",
    "The wall falls back into the moat. Do not use the army. In your own city, commands come from the common people. Perseverance brings danger. The cycle completes. The wall that protected the city falls back into the moat that surrounded it. Defenses become debris. In this moment, do not use the army—do not try to force control. Commands now come from the common people, not from above. The time of peace has passed, and the time of returning has begun. Perseverance here, trying to hold onto peace, brings danger. Let the wall fall. Let the moat receive it. Something new will rise from the rubble."

    description: "Heaven below, earth above. This inversion is the secret of peace: heaven, which belongs above, places itself below. Earth, which belongs below, places itself above. They exchange places, they meet, they mingle. Heaven does not insist on being above; it descends. Earth does not insist on being below; it rises. In their mutual yielding, true peace is born. The strong makes itself weak, and the weak makes itself strong. This is the holy marriage of heaven and earth."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The highest good is like water. Water benefits all things and does not contend. It stays in lowly places that others despise. Thus it is near the Tao.' Hexagram 11 is water's fullest expression—heaven itself descending to the lowly places, earth itself rising to meet it. This is peace: not the stillness of death, but the dance of life. Heaven gives itself to earth; earth gives itself to heaven. They do not contend; they complete. In your own life, peace comes when you stop insisting on your place and start flowing to where you are needed. When you descend, you are raised. When you yield, you are filled. The small departs, the great approaches—not because you chased it, but because you made yourself ready to receive it. This is the peace that passes understanding, and it is yours now."
