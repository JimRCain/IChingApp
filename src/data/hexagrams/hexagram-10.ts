  heart: "Stepping on the tail of a tiger. The danger is real—the tiger could turn, could bite, could end you. But it does not. Not because you are lucky, but because you tread correctly. Your step is light, your intention pure, your awareness complete. The tiger feels no threat, so it does not react. This is treading: walking through a dangerous world with such presence, such alignment, that even the tiger lets you pass. The path is narrow, but it is there. And you are walking it.",
  judgment: "The world is full of tigers—dangers, conflicts, powers greater than you. To walk through it without being bitten is not a matter of luck; it is a matter of tread. How do you step? Are you heavy, arrogant, unaware? Then the tiger will turn. Are you light, humble, present? Then it will let you pass. Success comes not from conquering the tiger, but from walking in such a way that the tiger does not feel threatened. This is the art of treading: to move through danger without provoking it, to be in the world without disturbing it, to follow the path so precisely that even the tiger respects your passage.",
  image: "Heaven above, the lake below. The noble one distinguishes between high and low, and thus settles the will of the people. Heaven above, the lake below—the highest and the lowest, the most exalted and the most humble. Between them, all the levels of existence. The noble one looks at this image and understands: to tread correctly, you must see clearly. Distinguish what is high from what is low, what is worthy from what is base, what is lasting from what is fleeting. Not to judge, but to orient. When you see clearly, your will settles. When your will settles, your tread becomes steady. And the people, watching you, find their own will settled. This is leadership through right treading.",
  lines: [
    "Treading in the simple way. Going forward without blame. The simplest path is the best. Not clever, not devious, not ambitious—just simple, direct, honest. You tread in the way that requires no explanation, no justification, no defense. This simplicity itself protects you. Going forward on this path, there is no blame. The tiger sees you coming, sees your simplicity, and does not bite. There is nothing to fear in one who has nothing to hide.",
    "Treading a smooth, level path. The perseverance of a dark person brings good fortune. The path is smooth, even, easy. This is not the time for great ambition or dramatic action. It is the time for steady, quiet perseverance—the perseverance of the dark person, the one who does not seek attention, who works in the shadows, who tends what is theirs without needing to be seen. This dark perseverance brings good fortune because it does not disturb the tiger. It simply walks, steadily, levelly, and the tiger sleeps on.",
    "A one-eyed person can see, a lame person can tread. But both tread on the tail of the tiger and are bitten. Misfortune. This is the warrior acting for the great ruler. You have some ability—one eye sees, one leg walks—but not enough. You go forward anyway, and the tiger bites. The misfortune is not in your limitation; it is in your failure to recognize it. The warrior who acts for the great ruler must see clearly, must tread steadily. If you cannot, do not act. Wait. Heal. Find another way. The tiger does not make exceptions for good intentions.",
    "Treading on the tail of the tiger. Caution and care lead to good fortune in the end. Finally, you are treading directly on the tail. Not near it, not beside it—on it. The danger is maximum, the risk absolute. But you are cautious, careful, fully present. Every step is measured, every breath conscious. Because of this, the tiger does not bite. In the end, good fortune follows—not because the danger passed, but because you met it with such complete awareness that it could not harm you. The tiger is still there. You are still on its tail. But you are treading correctly, so you pass.",
    "Treading decisively. Perseverance brings danger. You have reached a point where decision is required. Not hesitation, not caution—decisive tread. But the line warns: perseverance in this decisiveness brings danger. Because decisiveness, if prolonged, becomes rigidity. The tiger feels your hardness and stirs. The wise one knows when to be decisive and when to yield. If you must tread decisively, do it, then soften. Do not make a habit of it. The tiger respects flexibility more than force.",
    "Look to your conduct and weigh the signs. When the cycle is complete, there is supreme good fortune. The end of the journey. You have trodden the whole path, through simplicity, through darkness, through danger, through decision. Now look back. Weigh your conduct. Read the signs your own passage has left. The cycle is complete—not because you reached a destination, but because you have walked the whole way with awareness. This looking back, this weighing, this completion—this is supreme good fortune. Not the fortune of arrival, but the fortune of having trodden well."
