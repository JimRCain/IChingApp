  heart: "Water over mountain. The mountain rises, steep and unyielding. Water flows, seeking the lowest ground. Before the mountain, water must pause, must find a way around, must wait. Obstruction is this: the natural flow blocked, the way ahead closed. Not a punishment, not a failure—simply a fact of the landscape. In obstruction, the wise one does not rage against the mountain; they stop, look, and find another way.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "蹇。利西南，不利東北。利見大人，貞吉。",
    rendering: "Obstruction. The southwest furthers; the northeast does not further. It furthers to see the great person. Perseverance brings good fortune."
  },
  judgment: "When you meet obstruction, do not push forward blindly. The southwest—the direction of retreat, of openness—furthers. The northeast—the direction of advance, of the steepest climb—does not further. In obstruction, it furthers to see the great person—one who sees clearly, who can show you the way around. Perseverance in this seeking, this waiting, brings good fortune. The water does not fight the mountain; it finds a way around. So must you.",
  image: "Water over mountain. The noble one turns within and cultivates virtue. Water over mountain: the flow is blocked, the way is steep. The noble one learns: when outward progress is obstructed, turn within. Cultivate virtue—patience, clarity, compassion. The mountain will not move, but you can move within. This inner cultivation prepares you for the time when the way opens again.",

    "Going leads to obstruction, coming meets praise. To go forward now is to meet obstruction. To come back, to retreat, is to be praised. Not because retreat is glorious, but because it is wise. The praise is for the wisdom, not the retreat.",
    "The king's servant meets obstruction upon obstruction. Not through his own fault. Some obstructions are not of your making. The king's servant, faithful and true, still meets obstacle after obstacle. This is not his fault; it is the nature of the times. The line offers no solution, only recognition. Sometimes you must simply endure.",
    "Going leads to obstruction, therefore he returns. The simplest reading: you try, it's blocked, you return. No blame in this—it is just the natural response. Obstruction teaches you when to stop.",
    "Going leads to obstruction, coming leads to union. To go forward is blocked; to return is to find connection. In returning, you meet others who also stopped, who also wait. Union is possible now, in the pause. Do not see obstruction only as loss; see it also as the condition for community.",
    "In the midst of the greatest obstruction, friends come. The deepest block, the hardest time—and friends appear. Not to remove the obstruction, but to be with you in it. Their presence is the help. Perseverance in this shared waiting brings good fortune.",
    "Going leads to obstruction, coming leads to great good fortune. It furthers to see the great person. The final line: after all the obstruction, the return, the waiting—now, coming (not going) leads to great good fortune. And it furthers to see the great person—the one who sees clearly, who can guide you through what remains. Obstruction has taught you; now you are ready."

    description: "Mountain below, water above. Water encounters mountain and is blocked. This is obstruction: the natural flow stopped by something immovable. The water does not fight; it waits, it pools, it finds another way. In obstruction, become water—patient, persistent, adaptable."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The softest thing in the world rides over the hardest thing in the world.' Hexagram 39 is the softest thing—water—meeting the hardest—mountain. Water does not try to break the mountain; it goes around, under, through—slowly, patiently. In the end, water shapes the mountain more than the mountain shapes water. Obstruction is not defeat; it is the beginning of a deeper path."
