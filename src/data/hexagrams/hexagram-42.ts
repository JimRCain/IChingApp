  heart: "Wind over thunder. Thunder stirs below, wind spreads above—movement and influence together, multiplying effect. Increase is not mere addition; it is amplification. What is good grows, what is true spreads. Not through force, but through the natural synergy of aligned forces. In times of increase, the wise one does not hoard; they let the wind carry the thunder's sound so that all may hear.",

    chinese: "益。利有攸往，利涉大川。",
    rendering: "Increase. It furthers one to undertake something. It furthers one to cross the great water."
  },
  judgment: "Increase is the season of growth, of amplification, of blessing. It furthers to undertake something—action now bears fruit many times over. It furthers to cross the great water—the greatest challenges can now be met because you are augmented by forces beyond yourself. Not your own power alone, but power multiplied by timing, by alignment, by the synergy of heaven and earth. In increase, do not be prideful; be grateful. The wind that spreads the thunder's sound is not your doing; it is the Tao's gift. Receive it, use it, and pass it on.",
  image: "Wind over thunder. The noble one sees the good and moves toward it. When he sees a fault, he turns from it. Wind over thunder: the wind carries the thunder's sound everywhere. The noble one learns: see the good and move toward it—let your life be carried by what amplifies virtue. When you see a fault, turn from it—do not let it grow. In increase, you have more power; use it to amplify the good and diminish the harmful.",
  lines: [
    "It furthers to accomplish great deeds. Supreme good fortune. No blame. At the beginning of increase, great deeds are possible. Supreme good fortune because the timing is right. No blame because you act with the current, not against it.",
    "Someone increases you. Ten pairs of turtles cannot oppose it. Perseverance brings good fortune. The king presents him before God. Good fortune. The gift comes—unasked, undeniable. Even the turtles, the oracles, cannot oppose this increase. Perseverance in receiving brings good fortune. The king presents you before God—you are acknowledged by the highest. Good fortune because you are aligned.",
    "One is increased by unfortunate events. No blame. You are sincere and walk the middle way. You report to the prince. Even increase can come through what seems unfortunate—a loss that opens a door, a failure that teaches. No blame because you remain sincere, walking the middle way. Report to the prince—acknowledge the source of increase, even if it came through pain.",
    "If you walk the middle way and report to the prince, he follows. It furthers to be used in the removal of the capital. Steadiness in the middle way earns trust. The prince follows your advice. Now you may be used for great tasks—the removal of the capital, a transformation of the highest order. Increase has prepared you for this.",
    "If you have a sincere heart, do not ask. Supreme good fortune. Everyone knows your sincerity. When your heart is truly sincere, you do not need to ask; others know. Supreme good fortune because you are trusted without words. Increase has made your sincerity visible.",
    "He increases others without being increased himself. Others attack him. He does not steady his heart. Misfortune. The final warning: if you increase others but do not receive increase yourself—if you give endlessly without replenishment—others may attack you, and you cannot steady your heart. Misfortune follows because you have neglected your own need for increase. Give, but also receive. The Tao flows both ways."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The Tao gives birth to one, one gives birth to two, two gives birth to three, three gives birth to ten thousand things.' Hexagram 42 is the multiplication of the ten thousand things. Increase is the natural outgrowth of alignment. When you are in the Tao, everything you touch multiplies—not because you are powerful, but because you are in the current. The wind does not create the thunder; it carries it. In increase, be the wind—carry what is good, spread what is true, and let the Tao do the rest."
