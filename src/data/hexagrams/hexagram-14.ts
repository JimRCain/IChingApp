  heart: "Fire above heaven. The sun in the sky, shining on all things. This is possession in great measure: not hoarding, but having enough to share. The sun does not keep its light; it gives it freely. In the same way, true possession is measured not by what you hold, but by what you can give.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "大有。元亨。",
    rendering: "Possession in Great Measure. Supreme success."
  },
  judgment: "Possession in great measure. Supreme success. When you have much, the test is not how you got it but how you use it. If you hold with an open hand, if you recognize that what you have is not yours alone, supreme success follows. The sun shines on all; you can do no less.",
  image: "Fire in heaven above. The image of Possession in Great Measure. The noble one curbs evil and furthers good, and thereby obeys the benevolent will of heaven. Fire in heaven is visible to all. It does not hide. The noble one learns from this: to curb what harms, to further what helps, and in doing so, to align with heaven's benevolent will. Possession is not for oneself; it is for the work.",
  lines: [
    "No relationship with what is harmful. There is no blame in this. If one remains conscious of difficulty, one remains without blame. The first step in great possession is to know what not to hold. No relationship with what is harmful. This seems simple, but it is the foundation. Stay conscious of the difficulty—of how easy it is to slip—and you remain without blame.",
    "A big wagon for loading. One may undertake something. No blame. You have the capacity now—the big wagon that can carry much. You may undertake something because you have the resources. But the wagon is for loading, not for showing off. Use it for the work, and there is no blame.",
    "A prince offers it to the Son of Heaven. A petty person cannot do this. When you have much, the test is what you do with it. The prince offers to the Son of Heaven—not keeping for themselves, but giving to the highest purpose. A petty person cannot do this; they hold tight. But you are not petty. You offer what you have, and in offering, you become worthy of more.",
    "He makes a difference between himself and his neighbor. No blame. Possession does not mean losing yourself in giving. You know where you end and your neighbor begins. This clarity is not selfishness; it is wisdom. You cannot give what you do not have. Keep yourself clear, and your giving will be clear too.",
    "He whose truth is accessible, yet dignified, has good fortune. Your truth—what you have, what you know, what you are—is accessible to others. But you are not cheap, not desperate to be liked. You maintain your dignity. This balance brings good fortune. People trust what is both accessible and dignified.",
    "He is blessed by heaven. Good fortune. Nothing that does not further. At the peak of great possession, you are blessed by heaven itself. This is not because you earned it, but because you have been a good steward. You held with open hands. You gave without losing yourself. Now heaven gives to you. Good fortune. Nothing that does not further."

    description: "Heaven below, fire above. The sun in the sky—the image of great possession. Heaven provides the strength, the foundation, the inner wealth. Fire provides the visibility, the warmth, the outer sharing. Together, they create the sun: something so rich it can give endlessly without diminishing. This is true possession: not the vault that locks, but the sun that shines."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'To know when you have enough is to be rich. To die but not perish is to be eternally present.' Hexagram 14 teaches the first truth: to know when you have enough. The sun does not hoard its light; it shines until it is gone, and yet it is never gone. This is the paradox of great possession: the more you give, the more you have. The more you hold with open hands, the more you can hold. In your own life, measure your possession not by what you keep, but by what you can give. The sun is the richest thing in the sky because it gives everything. Be the sun."
