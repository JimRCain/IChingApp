  heart: "Wind over lake. Wind moves, lake reflects—both responding, both true. Inner Truth is the quality of being real at the core, of having a center that cannot be shaken. The wind does not pretend to be still; the lake does not pretend to be deep. They are what they are, and in their truth, they interact harmoniously. The wise one cultivates this inner truth: a heart so sincere that it needs no defense, no pretense, no mask.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "中孚。豚魚吉，利涉大川，利貞。",
    rendering: "Inner Truth. It brings good fortune even to pigs and fish. It furthers one to cross the great water. Perseverance furthers."
  },
  judgment: "Inner truth is so powerful that it reaches even pigs and fish—the simplest, most unreflective beings. If you are truly sincere, your truth communicates itself to all, without words. It furthers one to cross the great water—the greatest difficulty—because inner truth is a boat that cannot sink. Perseverance in this sincerity furthers all things. The wind does not try to move the lake; it simply moves, and the lake responds. So too, you need only be true; the world will respond.",
  image: "Wind over lake. The noble one discusses criminal cases in order to delay executions. Wind over lake: the wind stirs, the lake reflects. The noble one learns: in criminal cases, delay—not to avoid justice, but to ensure truth. Inner truth requires time to emerge. Rushed judgments miss it. The noble one waits, reflects, and only then decides.",
  lines: [
    "Being prepared brings good fortune. If there are hidden motives, it is restless. The first step: prepare. Be ready for truth to emerge. If you have hidden motives, you will be restless, and the truth will not come. Prepare by being empty, open.",
    "A crane calling in the shade. Its young answer it. I have a good goblet. I will share it with you. The image of inner truth: the crane calls, and its young answer without seeing it. Truth communicates itself. The goblet shared is truth shared. No need for words; the heart speaks directly.",
    "He finds a comrade. Now he beats the drum, now he stops. Now he sobs, now he sings. Inner truth in relationship: the comrade found, the rhythm of connection—drumming and stopping, sobbing and singing. The full range of true feeling, expressed without pretense. No blame.",
    "The moon nearly full. The horses' mate is lost. No blame. The moon nearly full—truth almost complete. But the mate is lost—connection broken. Yet no blame because the truth itself is not diminished. Inner truth does not depend on others.",
    "He possesses truth. He has no blame. Simple, direct: he possesses truth. No blame because truth needs nothing else. The line is almost redundant; it simply states what is.",
    "Truth that crows. The cock crows, but it does not fly. Misfortune. Truth that is only noise, only display, not substance. The cock crows but cannot fly. This is not inner truth; it is its counterfeit. Misfortune because it will be found out."

    description: "Lake below, wind above. The wind moves, the lake reflects—both in their true nature. Inner Truth is this: being so completely what you are that your presence communicates itself without effort. The lake does not try to reflect; it simply does. The wind does not try to move; it simply does. Be like them."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'He who knows does not speak; he who speaks does not know.' Hexagram 61 is the knowing that does not speak, the truth that communicates without words. The crane calls in the shade, and its young answer—not by sight, but by recognition. The sage, hidden, still influences all. Inner truth is not a message; it is a state of being. When you are true, the world cannot help but respond, because truth is the native language of all things."
