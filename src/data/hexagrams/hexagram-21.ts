  name: "Biting Through (噬嗑 - Shì Kè)",
  heart: "Thunder above, fire below. The thunder crashes; the fire burns. Between them, something hard must be bitten through. This is not gentle work. There is an obstacle—a lie, a betrayal, a corruption—that cannot be talked around, cannot be wished away. It must be bitten through. The teeth meet the bone. There is pain. There is resistance. But there is also the possibility of breakthrough. Biting through is the justice that restores.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "噬嗑。亨。利用獄。",
    rendering: "Biting Through has success. It is favorable to let justice be administered."
  },
  judgment: "Biting Through has success. It is favorable to let justice be administered. Something stands in the way—of truth, of harmony, of progress. It cannot be avoided; it must be bitten through. Success is possible, but it requires the willingness to engage with what is hard, what is resistant, what may hurt. Justice must be administered—not as punishment, but as restoration. The obstacle must be removed so the whole can function again.",
  image: "Thunder and lightning. The image of Biting Through. The ancient kings made firm the laws through clearly defined penalties. Thunder and lightning: the sudden, the bright, the unavoidable. The ancient kings understood this. They made firm the laws—not arbitrary, not flexible, but clear. They defined penalties—not cruel, not excessive, but proportionate. This is biting through: the clear consequence that removes the obstacle. Not vengeance; justice. Not anger; clarity.",

    "His feet are fastened in the stocks, so that his toes disappear. No blame. The punishment is light—the feet are fastened, the toes disappear into the stocks. This is the beginning of justice. No blame follows because the punishment fits the crime. The small transgression receives the small correction. This is how biting through begins: with clarity about what is wrong.",
    "Bites through tender meat, so that his nose disappears. No blame. The biting goes deeper—through tender meat, to the nose. The punishment is more significant, but still proportionate. No blame follows because the justice is clear. The transgression was more serious; the correction matches it. This is biting through: not excessive, not lenient, but exact.",
    "Bites on old dried meat and strikes on something poisonous. Slight humiliation. No blame. The biting encounters something hard—old dried meat, something poisonous. This is the difficult case: the transgression that has been hidden, that has festered. There is slight humiliation in uncovering it, in dealing with it. But no blame. The work must be done. The poison must be removed.",
    "Bites on dried gristly meat. Receives metal arrows. It furthers one to be mindful of difficulties and to be persevering. Good fortune. The biting is even harder now—dried gristly meat, something that resists. You receive metal arrows—tools, weapons, the means to bite through. It furthers one to be mindful of difficulties and to be persevering. This is not easy work. But if you stay mindful, if you persevere, good fortune comes. The obstacle will yield.",
    "Bites on dried lean meat. Receives yellow gold. Perseveringly aware of danger. No blame. The meat is lean—less substantial, but still hard. You receive yellow gold—the reward, the recognition for the work. But you remain perseveringly aware of danger. The gold itself can become an obstacle if you cling to it. Stay aware. No blame follows if you do.",
    "His neck is fastened in the wooden cangue, so that his ears disappear. Misfortune. The punishment has become excessive—the neck is fastened, the ears disappear. This is no longer justice; it is oppression. Misfortune follows. Biting through has its limits. When the punishment exceeds the crime, when the correction becomes the new obstacle, you have lost the way. Stop. Restore balance."

    description: "Fire below, thunder above. The fire illuminates what is wrong; the thunder enacts the consequence. This is biting through: the clarity that sees the obstacle, the force that removes it. Fire does not hesitate; it burns. Thunder does not negotiate; it crashes. Together, they create the justice that restores. Not cruel, not lenient, but clear."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'When the great Tao is forgotten, kindness and morality arise. When wisdom and intelligence are born, great hypocrisy appears.' Hexagram 21 acknowledges this truth: sometimes the Tao is forgotten, and justice must be administered. But the Taoist administers justice without hatred, without the illusion that punishment itself is the solution. The thunder does not hate the cloud it crashes through. The fire does not hate the wood it burns. They simply do what is necessary. In your own biting through, find this same clarity. Do not bite from anger; bite from necessity. Do not punish from cruelty; punish from the need to restore. The obstacle must be removed. But you must not become the new obstacle."
