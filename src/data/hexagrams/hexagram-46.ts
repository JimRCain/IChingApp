  heart: "Wind rising over earth. Gentle, persistent, unstoppable—the wind does not fight the earth; it simply rises. Pushing Upward is not aggressive striving; it is the natural ascent of what is light, what is true, what is aligned. The seedling pushes through soil not by force but by growth. The wise one rises not by ambition but by virtue. When your inner being is light, you rise as naturally as wind.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "升。元亨。用見大人，勿恤。南征吉。",
    rendering: "Pushing Upward. Supreme success. One may see the great person. Do not grieve. To march south brings good fortune."
  },
  judgment: "Supreme success attends those who rise naturally, without forcing. It is given to you to see the great person—one who embodies the height you seek. Do not grieve if the ascent seems slow; it is steady. To march south—toward the light, toward warmth—brings good fortune. South is the direction of advance, of increase, of clarity. Push upward, not by straining, but by becoming light. Shed what is heavy—resentment, attachment, fear—and you will rise as surely as wind.",
  image: "Wind rising over earth. The noble one accumulates small things to achieve the high and great. Wind rising over earth: it begins as a breeze, barely felt; it ends as a gale, sweeping all before it. The noble one learns: accumulate small things. Not grand gestures, but daily virtues; not dramatic sacrifices, but small kindnesses. These accumulate, and in time, they lift you to the high and great. Pushing Upward is not a leap; it is the result of countless small ascents.",

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The journey of a thousand miles begins under your feet.' Hexagram 46 is the journey of ascent, step by step, inch by inch. The wind does not rush; it rises. The seedling does not strain; it grows. In pushing upward, the wise one learns that the only way to rise is to become light, and the only way to become light is to let go of what is heavy."
