  heart: "Wind rising over earth. Gentle, persistent, unstoppable—the wind does not fight the earth; it simply rises. Pushing Upward is not aggressive striving; it is the natural ascent of what is light, what is true, what is aligned. The seedling pushes through soil not by force but by growth. The wise one rises not by ambition but by virtue. When your inner being is light, you rise as naturally as wind.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "升。元亨。用見大人，勿恤。南征吉。",
    rendering: "Pushing Upward. Supreme success. One may see the great person. Do not grieve. To march south brings good fortune."
  },
  judgment: "Supreme success attends those who rise naturally, without forcing. It is given to you to see the great person—one who embodies the height you seek. Do not grieve if the ascent seems slow; it is steady. To march south—toward the light, toward warmth—brings good fortune. South is the direction of advance, of increase, of clarity. Push upward, not by straining, but by becoming light. Shed what is heavy—resentment, attachment, fear—and you will rise as surely as wind.",
  image: "Wind rising over earth. The noble one accumulates small things to achieve the high and great. Wind rising over earth: it begins as a breeze, barely felt; it ends as a gale, sweeping all before it. The noble one learns: accumulate small things. Not grand gestures, but daily virtues; not dramatic sacrifices, but small kindnesses. These accumulate, and in time, they lift you to the high and great. Pushing Upward is not a leap; it is the result of countless small ascents.",
  lines: [
    "Pushing upward that meets confidence brings great good fortune. At the first step, confidence—from yourself, from others—greets your ascent. This is great good fortune because it affirms that you are on the right path. Trust this confidence, and continue.",
    "If you are sincere, it furthers to bring even a small offering. No blame. Sincerity is the fuel of ascent. Even a small offering, given truly, furthers your rise. No blame because you give what you have, not what you lack.",
    "Pushing upward into an empty city. The city is empty—no opposition, no support, just space. This can be disorienting. But the line does not judge; it simply observes. Pushing upward into emptiness requires its own kind of faith.",
    "The king offers him Mount Qi. Good fortune. No blame. Mount Qi is the sacred mountain, the place of ancestral blessing. The king—the highest authority—offers this to you. Good fortune because you are honored. No blame because you did not seek it; it came as recognition of your true ascent.",
    "Perseverance brings good fortune. Pushing upward by steps. The ascent is gradual, step by step. Perseverance in this steady climbing brings good fortune. Not a leap, but a stair; each step solid, each rise earned.",
    "Pushing upward in darkness. It furthers to be unremittingly persevering. The final ascent may be in darkness—unseen, unrecognized, unsupported. But it furthers to be unremittingly persevering. The darkness is not a sign of wrong path; it is simply the condition of this stage. Push upward anyway. The light will come."

    description: "Wind below, earth above. Wind rises through earth, gently, persistently. This is Pushing Upward: the natural ascent of what is light, what is true. The earth does not block the wind; it yields to it. So too, the world yields to those who rise through virtue, not force."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The journey of a thousand miles begins under your feet.' Hexagram 46 is the journey of ascent, step by step, inch by inch. Not the thousand miles of horizontal travel, but the vertical climb toward the light. The wind does not rush; it rises. The seedling does not strain; it grows. In pushing upward, the wise one learns that the only way to rise is to become light, and the only way to become light is to let go of what is heavy. Shed, and ascend."
