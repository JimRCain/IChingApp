  heart: "Six unbroken lines, stacked like a ladder to the sky. Pure yang. The force that moves the stars without effort, that turns the seasons without hurry. Before any doing, there is this: the power simply to be, to generate, to begin. The Creative does not struggle—it creates by being itself, the way the sky does not try to be vast, it simply is.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "乾。元亨利貞。",
    rendering: "THE CREATIVE works sublime success, Furthering through perseverance."
  },
  judgment: "There is a power in you that precedes all action. It is not something you earn or achieve—it is your birthright, the original energy that brought you here. When you act from this place, success follows not because you forced it, but because you aligned with something larger. The four virtues are one: origin that unfolds, flow that encounters no obstacle, nature that finds its true expression, and the firmness that endures. Do not mistake this for ambition. The Creative does not grasp; it radiates.",
  image: "The movement of heaven is full of power. Thus the superior person makes themselves strong and untiring. Heaven does not pause. It does not rush. It simply moves, endlessly, like breath, like a heartbeat. To be strong and untiring is not to push against the world, but to remain so deeply yourself that you never need to stop. Like the sky that holds the stars without effort, you hold your center through all seasons.",
  allLines: "When all the lines are nines, it means: There appears a flight of dragons without heads. Good fortune.",
  lines: [
    "Hidden dragon. Do not act. The power is there, coiled like a dragon beneath the earth, but the time is not yet ripe. To push now would be to break the sprout before it breaks the soil. Rest in the darkness. Let the roots grow. The world does not need to see you yet. It needs you to become real.",
    "Dragon appearing in the field. It furthers one to see the great person. Now the first green shoot appears. Not yet a tree, but unmistakably alive. You emerge into the field of human affairs, and those with eyes to see recognize something genuine in you. Do not mistake this for fame or status. It is simply the natural result of being real—others feel it, the way they feel sunlight without being told.",
    "All day long, the creative person is actively creating. At nightfall, their mind is still beset with cares. Danger. No blame. The work has begun, and it is good. But with doing comes the noise of doing—plans, worries, the endless chatter of 'what next.' This is the danger: that the activity consumes the stillness from which it came. The sage works all day, then returns to silence. Can you?",
    "Wavering flight over the depths. No blame. Now you have climbed high enough to see the abyss. Below you, the vast unknown. Two paths open: to soar higher into the world's view, or to dive deep into solitude and self-discovery. Neither is wrong. The only mistake is to choose from fear. Ask the depths which way is yours.",
    "Flying dragon in the heavens. It furthers one to see the great person. At last, full expression. The dragon that was hidden, then appearing, then active, then hovering, now flies free across the sky. This is not conquest—it is fulfillment. Like a tree that has reached its full height and now simply offers shade. Those who see you at this stage are blessed not by your power, but by your completion.",
    "Arrogant dragon will have cause to repent. The sky has no top. To keep climbing beyond yourself is to leave the earth entirely, to become nothing. The dragon that forgets it once came from the depths loses its way. Pride is not the fall—it is the forgetting that you were ever small. Stay connected to the ground, even in flight."

    description: "Heaven above heaven. Movement generating more movement. This is not repetition, but the endless unfolding of what is genuine. Like one wave following another, each new, each the same ocean. The lower heaven is your inner source; the upper heaven is your outer expression. When they are the same, you live without division."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The Tao never acts, yet nothing is left undone.' Hexagram 1 is the living proof. Pure yang, pure creative power—yet it does not grasp, demand, or strive. It simply is, and in its being, all things arise. The dragon does not try to be powerful; it is powerful, and so it flies. The sky does not try to be vast; it is vast, and so it holds the stars. The sage does not try to lead; they are real, and so others follow—not because they are pushed, but because they recognize something they already carry within themselves. This is the teaching of The Creative: before any doing, be. And from that being, let action flow like water from an endless spring."
