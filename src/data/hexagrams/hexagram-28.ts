  heart: "Lake above, wood below. The lake rises above the trees—the water too high, the weight too great. This is preponderance of the great: the excess that cannot be sustained. The beam sags under the weight. The structure is strained. This is not a time for small measures. The situation is extraordinary; it requires extraordinary action. But be careful: the excess that lifts can also drown.",

    rendering: "Preponderance of the Great. The ridgepole sags to the breaking point. It furthers one to have somewhere to go. Success."

  judgment: "Preponderance of the Great. The ridgepole sags to the breaking point. It furthers one to have somewhere to go. Success. The weight is too great. The ridgepole—the central beam—sags. It is at the breaking point. This is not a time to stay put. It furthers one to have somewhere to go. Move. Act. Do not wait for the collapse. Success is possible, but only if you move with the weight, not against it.",
  image: "The lake rises above the trees. The image of Preponderance of the Great. The noble one, when they stand alone, is unconcerned. If they have to renounce the world, they are undaunted. The lake above the trees: the water is too high, the weight is too great. The noble one learns from this: to stand alone without concern, to renounce the world without fear. When the weight is extraordinary, the response must be extraordinary. Do not cling to what cannot hold.",

    "To spread white rushes underneath. No blame. You spread white rushes underneath—the soft beneath the hard, the cushion beneath the weight. This is care. This is preparation. No blame follows because you are honoring the gravity of the situation. The weight is great; treat it with care.",
    "A dry poplar sprouts at the root. An older man takes a young wife. Everything furthers. The dry poplar sprouts at the root—new life from what seemed dead. An older man takes a young wife—the union of opposites, the unexpected pairing. Everything furthers because the extraordinary situation calls for extraordinary measures. Do not be bound by convention.",
    "The ridgepole sags to the breaking point. Misfortune. The ridgepole sags—the central beam is failing. This is misfortune. The weight is too great. The structure cannot hold. Recognize this. Do not pretend otherwise. The misfortune is in the situation, not in you. But you must respond.",
    "The ridgepole is braced. Good fortune. If there are ulterior motives, it is humiliating. The ridgepole is braced—supported, strengthened. This brings good fortune. But if there are ulterior motives—if the bracing is done for show, for gain—it is humiliating. The support must be genuine. The motive must be clear.",
    "A withered poplar puts forth flowers. An older woman takes a husband. No blame. No praise. The withered poplar flowers—the last bloom, the final effort. An older woman takes a husband—the union that comes late. No blame, no praise. It is what it is. Neither good nor bad. It simply is. Do not expect more than this.",
    "One must go through the water. It goes over one's head. Misfortune. No blame. You must go through the water—but it goes over your head. You are submerged. This is misfortune. But no blame. You did what was necessary. The situation was extraordinary. You acted. The outcome was not in your control. This is the teaching of preponderance: sometimes you do everything right and still are submerged. No blame. But misfortune."

    description: "Wood below, lake above. The lake rises above the trees—the water too high, the weight too great. This is preponderance of the great: the excess that strains the structure. The wood bends; the water rises. The beam sags. This is not a stable situation. It requires action. It requires movement. It requires the willingness to let go of what cannot hold."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.' Hexagram 28 is the warning against excess: the lake that rises too high, the weight that breaks the beam. But it is also the teaching of extraordinary times: when the situation is extraordinary, ordinary measures will not work. The sage knows when to hold and when to release. When the ridgepole sags, do not pretend it is straight. Act. Move. Let go of what cannot hold. The water will find its level. You will find yours."
