    "It must be checked with a brake of metal. Perseverance brings good fortune. If you let things take their course, you will experience misfortune. A lean pig will certainly be wild. The first meeting: restrain it, check it with a brake. Not to stop it, but to guide it. Perseverance in this checking brings good fortune. If you let it run wild, misfortune follows. A lean pig—deprived, hungry—is wild. Give it boundaries, and it can be received.",

    "There is no skin on his thighs. Walking comes hard. Danger. No great blame. As in breakthrough, the unprotected thighs make walking hard. Danger is present, but no great blame because the meeting itself is not harmful, only the condition you bring to it.",

    "He comes to meet with his horns. Humiliation. No blame. To meet with horns—aggressively, defensively—brings humiliation. You are not ready to receive. But the line says no blame—perhaps because you acted as you knew, or because the meeting itself, though mishandled, still occurred. Next time, lower the horns."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.' Hexagram 44 is the meeting that cannot be planned. The wind meets heaven without arrangement. In your own life, the most important meetings come unbidden. Do not force them. Do not cling to them. Let them come, let them go. The Tao moves through encounters, not possessions."
