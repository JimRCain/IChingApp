  heart: "Wind under heaven. A stirring, a penetration—the first meeting of what was separate. Coming to Meet is not planned, not arranged; it happens. The wind moves where it will, and heaven receives it. In human life, meetings occur—with people, with ideas, with fate—that change everything. The wise one does not force such meetings; they simply remain open, like heaven receiving the wind, and let what comes, come.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "姤。女壯，勿用取女。",
    rendering: "Coming to Meet. The maiden is powerful. One should not marry such a maiden."
  },
  judgment: "The maiden is powerful—the one who comes to meet you is strong, perhaps too strong. To marry her, to bind her to you, would be a mistake. Some meetings are not for union; they are for recognition, for a moment of contact that changes both, but does not hold. In Coming to Meet, do not grasp. Do not try to make the meeting permanent. Let it be what it is—a crossing of paths, a gift of the moment. The wind meets heaven and passes on; heaven does not hold it. So too, meet what comes, and let it go.",
  image: "Wind under heaven. The noble one imparts his commands and proclaims them to the four quarters. Wind under heaven: the message is carried everywhere. The noble one learns: when you have something to impart, let it be carried by the wind. Proclaim it to the four quarters—not to control, but to offer. Some will receive it, some will not. That is the nature of meeting. The wind does not insist; it simply moves.",

    "It must be checked with a brake of metal. Perseverance brings good fortune. If you let things take their course, you will experience misfortune. A lean pig will certainly be wild. The first meeting: restrain it, check it with a brake. Not to stop it, but to guide it. Perseverance in this checking brings good fortune. If you let it run wild, misfortune follows. A lean pig—deprived, hungry—is wild. Give it boundaries, and it can be received.",
    "There is a fish in the package. No blame. But it does not further guests. The fish—the meeting, the gift—is there, but wrapped, hidden. No blame—it is yours. But it does not further guests; it is not for sharing. Some meetings are private; honor that.",
    "There is no skin on his thighs. Walking comes hard. Danger. No great blame. As in breakthrough, the unprotected thighs make walking hard. Danger is present, but no great blame because the meeting itself is not harmful, only the condition you bring to it.",
    "No fish in the package. Misfortune. The package is empty; the meeting promised nothing. This brings misfortune because you expected something. The line warns: do not project onto the meeting what is not there. See it as it is, empty or full.",
    "A melon covered with willow branches. Hidden lines. Then it drops down to you from heaven. The melon, ripe and sweet, is hidden—covered with willow branches, not obvious. But if you have the hidden lines—the inner readiness—it drops down to you from heaven. The meeting comes unbidden, a gift.",
    "He comes to meet with his horns. Humiliation. No blame. To meet with horns—aggressively, defensively—brings humiliation. You are not ready to receive. But the line says no blame—perhaps because you acted as you knew, or because the meeting itself, though mishandled, still occurred. Next time, lower the horns."

  heart: "Lake over earth. The lake gathers water, the earth receives it. Gathering Together is the drawing together of what belongs together—not by force, but by affinity. People gather around a common purpose, a shared vision, a beloved leader. Not because they are commanded, but because they recognize in the gathering a deeper home. The lake does not command the streams; they flow to it because it is low. So too, the wise leader is low, and all things flow to them.",

  },
  judgment: "When like gathers like, success follows naturally. The king approaches his temple—the place of meeting, of worship, of common purpose. It furthers to see the great person—one who embodies the vision, who can guide the gathering. Perseverance in this seeing furthers all things. To offer great sacrifice—to give generously to the common purpose—brings good fortune because it strengthens the bond. It furthers to undertake something—action now, from the gathered strength, will bear fruit. The gathering is not an end; it is the beginning of what can only be done together.",
  image: "Lake over earth. The noble one prepares weapons to meet the unforeseen. Lake over earth: water gathers, but what if the banks break? The noble one prepares—not from fear, but from wisdom. Gathering brings strength, but also vulnerability. Prepare weapons—not to attack, but to defend against the unforeseen. The noble one knows that even in harmony, the world can intrude. Be ready, not paranoid; prepared, not preemptively armed.",

    "If you are sincere but not to the end, there will be confusion. Then you gather them again. One cry, and you laugh. Do not worry. Going forward is without blame. The first attempt at gathering fails—sincere but incomplete, confusion arises. But you can gather again. One cry, and you laugh—the release of tension, the recognition that failure is not final. Do not worry; go forward, and there is no blame.",
    "Letting oneself be drawn brings good fortune. No blame. If you are sincere, it furthers to bring even a small offering. To be drawn to the gathering, to let yourself be pulled by affinity—this brings good fortune. No blame because you are not forcing. Even a small offering, sincerely given, furthers the whole.",
    "Gathering together brings sighs. Nothing that would further. Going forward is without blame. Slight humiliation. Sometimes gathering brings sighs—the recognition of what is lacking, what could be but is not. Nothing furthers in such a gathering; it is not yet time. Going forward is still without blame—you tried—but there is slight humiliation. Learn and wait.",
    "Great good fortune. No blame. Great gathering, great success. The time has come; all elements align. No blame because you did not force it; you simply received what came.",
    "If in gathering together one has position, there is no blame. If there are some who are not yet sincere, be magnanimous and persevere. Then regret disappears. When you have a position in the gathering—when you are the leader, the focal point—there is no blame in that. But some may not yet be sincere. Be magnanimous, persevere in openness, and regret will disappear. True leaders do not demand loyalty; they earn it over time.",
    "Lamenting and sighing, floods of tears. But no blame. At the peak, or perhaps after, there is grief. Lamenting, sighing, tears—because no gathering lasts forever. But no blame. The tears are the price of having loved the gathering. They do not diminish it; they honor it."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The highest good is like water. Water benefits all things and does not contend. It stays in lowly places that others despise. Thus it is near the Tao.' Hexagram 45 is water gathering in the low places—the people gathering around the leader who is humble, the streams flowing to the lake that is low. The wise leader does not seek followers; they become a valley, and the followers come of themselves. In this gathering, there is no force, only affinity. And in this affinity, there is the Tao."
