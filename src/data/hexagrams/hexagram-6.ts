  heart: "Heaven above, water below. The upward drive of the creative, the downward pull of the abyss. They move against each other, not together. This is conflict—not necessarily war, but opposition, friction, the grating of two forces that cannot yet align. It arises when waiting fails, when patience is exhausted, when the clouds refuse to release and the earth grows dry. Conflict is not evil; it is the natural result of misalignment. But like fire, it can warm or it can burn.",
  judgment: "You feel the blockage. Your sincerity, your genuine intention, meets resistance. The other does not hear, does not yield. In the middle of conflict, if you remain conscious, there can be good fortune—not because you win, but because you learn. But if you pursue conflict to the end, seeking victory, seeking to be right, misfortune follows. The wise one, when conflict arises, seeks out the great person—the one who sees clearly, who holds the center. Do not try to cross the great water now. The crossing requires trust, and trust is what conflict has eroded. Wait. See the great person. Let their clarity become yours.",
  image: "Heaven and water go their opposite ways. The noble one begins every undertaking with careful consideration. Heaven rises, water descends. Their paths diverge. This is the image of conflict: two forces moving in opposite directions. What can the noble one learn from this? To begin every undertaking with careful consideration. Before action, before commitment, weigh the direction. If two are to go together, they must first align. If alignment is not possible, better to know before the journey begins than to fight over which way to turn halfway through.",
  lines: [
    "Do not perpetuate the conflict. There is some gossip, but in the end it is good fortune. The conflict is small, a whisper, a misunderstanding. Do not feed it. If you let it drop, it will dissolve. The gossip is like a spark—if you do not add fuel, it dies. To perpetuate it would be to make it real. Let it go, and good fortune follows.",
    "Unable to contend, return and flee. The people of his town, three hundred households, are without blame. There are battles you cannot win, conflicts you cannot resolve. To recognize this is not cowardice; it is wisdom. Return, flee, not in shame but in clarity. The people of your place—your community, your true companions—will understand. They do not blame you for refusing a fight that could only destroy. Survival is sometimes the highest virtue.",
    "Feed on old virtue. Perseverance brings danger. In the end, good fortune comes. If you follow the king's business, do not seek glory. Old virtue—what you have built before, the integrity you have already cultivated—can sustain you for a time. But if you rely on it alone, and persevere in conflict, danger comes. The line advises: in the midst of conflict, do not seek to be seen, to be honored. Do your work quietly. Let the old virtue be your ground, not your banner. In the end, good fortune comes because you did not make yourself a target.",
    "Unable to contend, you return and change your purpose. You find peace in perseverance. Good fortune. The conflict has shown you that your original aim was not possible, not right, not yours. So you return, not defeated but redirected. You change your purpose. This is not surrender; it is adaptation. Water does not fight the rock; it flows around it, and in flowing, finds its way to the sea. To find peace in perseverance—the perseverance of the changed course—is good fortune indeed.",
    "Contending before him. Supreme good fortune. Here, the great person appears. You bring your conflict before one who sees clearly, who holds no personal stake. In their presence, the truth emerges, and the conflict resolves not by victory but by clarity. This is supreme good fortune: to be seen truly, to have the knot untied by a steady hand. The great person does not take sides; they reveal the center.",
    "Even if by chance you receive the leather belt, by the end of the morning it will have been snatched from you three times. The leather belt is a symbol of rank, of victory, of having won. But in conflict, winning is not possessing. What you gain through contention you cannot hold. By the end of the morning—quickly, inevitably—it is taken. Three times, meaning completely. This is the ultimate teaching of Conflict: there is no victory in it that lasts. The only true resolution is the one that restores alignment, not the one that proves you right."
