  binary: "111101",
  heart: "Heaven above, fire below. The flame rises to meet the sky. This is fellowship: not the small circle of friends, but the great community of those who share the light. Fire illuminates; heaven contains. Together, they create a space where all who seek the light can gather.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "同人。同人于野，亨。利涉大川，利君子貞。",
    rendering: "Fellowship with Others in the open. Success. It furthers one to cross the great water. The perseverance of the noble one furthers."

  judgment: "Fellowship with others in the open. Success. It furthers one to cross the great water. The perseverance of the noble one furthers. True fellowship is not secret, not exclusive. It happens in the open, where all can see. This openness is what makes success possible. With such fellowship, you can cross the great water—the great difficulty—because you do not cross alone.",
  image: "Heaven together with fire. The image of Fellowship with Others. The noble one organizes the clans and makes distinctions between things. Heaven and fire: one vast, one bright. Together, they show the way. The noble one learns from this: to organize what is scattered, to bring clans together, and at the same time to make clear distinctions. Fellowship is not the erasure of difference; it is the harmony of differences.",
  lines: [
    "Fellowship with others at the gate. No blame. The fellowship begins at the gate—not inside, where it would be exclusive, but at the entrance, where all can approach. This is the right beginning. No blame follows because you have not closed the door to anyone.",
    "Fellowship with others in the clan. Humiliation. When fellowship shrinks to the clan, to those who are already like you, it loses its power. This brings humiliation—not because the clan is bad, but because you have mistaken the part for the whole. True fellowship reaches beyond the familiar.",
    "He hides weapons in the thicket; he climbs the high hill in front of it. For three years he does not rise up. Sometimes fellowship requires preparation. You hide weapons—not for attack, but for defense. You climb high to see the terrain. And you wait. Three years is a long time, but some things cannot be rushed. Fellowship that is forced is not fellowship at all.",
    "He climbs up on his wall; he cannot attack. Good fortune. You have climbed high enough to see that attack is not the way. The wall was not for keeping others out; it was for seeing clearly. When you realize this, when you cannot attack because you see no enemy, good fortune follows. Fellowship begins with this seeing.",
    "Fellowship with others. First, they weep and wail, but afterward they laugh. The great meeting is not easy. First comes the weeping—the recognition of separation, of difference, of all that has kept you apart. But after the weeping, the laughing. This is the joy of finding each other after being lost. The tears make the laughter real.",
    "Fellowship with others in the meadow. No remorse. The meadow is open, unbounded. Here, fellowship happens without walls, without conditions. You meet in the common space, the shared ground. No remorse follows because you have not tried to possess or control. You have simply met, as equals, in the open."

    description: "Fire below, heaven above. The flame rises toward the sky, seeking union with the vastness. This is fellowship: the small light joining the great light. Fire brings clarity; heaven brings scope. Together, they create a space where all can see and all can belong. The lower fire is your inner clarity; the upper heaven is the outer community. When they align, you find your people."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The Tao is empty, yet use will not drain it. Deep, it is like the ancestor of the ten thousand things.' Hexagram 13 is the empty space that allows fellowship. Not the filled room that excludes, but the open meadow that includes. Fire does not compete with other fires; it joins with them to create greater light. Heaven does not select which clouds to hold; it holds all. In your own search for fellowship, find this same openness. Do not build walls; build fires. Those who seek the light will find their way to you."
