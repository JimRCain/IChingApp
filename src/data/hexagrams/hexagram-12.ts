  heart: "Heaven withdraws, earth sinks. They no longer meet. The creative power recedes into distance; the receptive ground grows cold and hard. Between them, nothing moves. This is standstill—not the peace of harmony, but the stillness of separation. The great departs, the small approaches. Communication ceases, growth stops, the fields lie fallow. And yet, even in this barren time, there is wisdom. The noble one does not fight the standstill; they wait, they preserve, they tend what cannot be taken away.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "否之匪人，不利君子貞，大往小來。",
    rendering: "Standstill. It is not favorable for the superior person to persevere. The great departs, the small approaches."
  },
  judgment: "There are times when the world closes in, when the channels of connection dry up, when everything you reach for recedes. This is standstill. Do not mistake it for your failure. The great departs—the vision, the inspiration, the support—and the small approaches—the petty, the constricting, the draining. In such a time, perseverance in the usual sense is not favorable. To push against the standstill only exhausts you. Instead, withdraw. Not in defeat, but in preservation. Tend what is yours alone: your integrity, your inner quiet, your connection to what is real beyond circumstance. The standstill will pass, as all things pass. When it does, you will be ready, because you did not waste yourself against it.",
  image: "Heaven and earth do not unite. The noble one falls back upon inner worth and avoids difficulty. They do not accept salary. Heaven above, earth below—but they do not meet. No rain falls, no vapor rises. The fields are barren. The noble one looks at this image and understands: when the world will not receive you, do not force your way in. Fall back upon inner worth—the value that needs no external validation. Avoid difficulty—not by hiding in fear, but by recognizing that this is not your time. Do not accept salary—do not seek reward from a world that is not in rhythm with you. The standstill is a time for inner cultivation, not outer achievement.",

    "When the grass is pulled, other stalks come with it. Perseverance brings good fortune. Success. Even in standstill, when you pull one stalk of grass, the others come with it. But here, the pulling is not for growth; it is for clearing. The weeds of confusion, of false hope, of misplaced effort—pull them, and they come with their kind. Perseverance in this clearing brings good fortune. Not success in the outer world, but success in preparing the ground for when heaven and earth meet again.",
    "They bear and endure. Good fortune for the common people. In standstill, the common people—those who cannot simply withdraw, who must continue to live, to work, to care for others—bear and endure. They do not have the luxury of retreat. And yet, in their bearing, there is a quiet good fortune. Not the good fortune of flourishing, but the good fortune of survival, of holding the line, of keeping the human things alive until better times come. This line honors them. It says: your endurance matters.",
    "They bear shame. The shame is not yours. In standstill, you may be blamed for what is not your fault. The world, frustrated and closed, looks for someone to hold responsible. You may bear shame—publicly, privately—but the line says clearly: the shame is not yours. Do not internalize it. Do not defend against it. Let it pass over you like weather. Your worth is not diminished by the world's misperception. Bear the shame, but do not carry it.",
    "Those who act in accordance with the decree are without blame. Those of like mind enjoy blessing. Even in standstill, there is a decree—a natural order, a way that is in accord with what is real. If you act in accordance with this deeper law, you are without blame. And you will find others who also follow this decree, those of like mind, and together you will enjoy a blessing that the standstill cannot touch. Not the blessing of outward success, but the blessing of true connection in a time of separation.",
    "Standstill comes to an end. Good fortune for the great person. But beware: 'It perishes, it perishes, thus tie it to a cluster of mulberry shoots.' The standstill will end. It always does. For the great person—the one who has preserved inner worth, who has waited without wasting—this ending brings good fortune. But the warning is urgent: 'It perishes, it perishes.' Do not assume the end is permanent. Tie your fortune to something resilient, like mulberry shoots that can bend without breaking. Be ready for the standstill to return, for all things cycle. Prepare, not in fear, but in wisdom.",
    "The standstill is overturned. First standstill, then good fortune. The cycle completes. What was closed opens. What was separated meets. The standstill is overturned—not by force, but by the natural return of heaven and earth to each other. First standstill, then good fortune. The order is important: you cannot have the good fortune without having first endured the standstill. The overturning is not a reward; it is a result. You endured, you preserved, you waited. Now the meeting returns, and you are ready to receive it."

    description: "Earth below, heaven above—but they do not meet. Earth sinks into itself; heaven rises away. Between them, an empty space, a vacuum. No exchange, no nourishment, no life. This is the geometry of standstill: each element retreats into its own pole, and the middle ground, where growth happens, is abandoned. The noble one sees this and understands: when the world is divided, do not try to bridge the gap by force. Instead, cultivate your own ground. Let heaven withdraw; let earth sink. Your work now is interior."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'When the great Tao is forgotten, kindness and morality arise. When wisdom and intelligence are born, great hypocrisy appears. When the six family relationships are out of harmony, filial piety and parental love arise. When the country is in chaos, loyal ministers appear.' Hexagram 12 is the time when the great Tao is forgotten, when wisdom and intelligence become hypocrisy, when relationships are out of harmony. It is the time of standstill—and it is precisely then that the virtues we most value appear. Not as solutions, but as signs of what is missing. The noble one in standstill does not try to fix the world; they embody the virtue that the world has forgotten, knowing that their embodiment itself is a seed for when heaven and earth meet again. The standstill is not eternal. The Tao always returns. Wait. Preserve. Be the seed."
