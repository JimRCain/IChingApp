  heart: "Mountain above, thunder below. The mountain is still; the thunder moves. Between them, the mouth—the place where what is taken in becomes what sustains. This is nourishment: not just the food you eat, but the words you speak, the thoughts you think, the company you keep. You are what you take in. You are also what you give out. The corners of the mouth reveal both.",

  judgment: "The Corners of the Mouth. Perseverance brings good fortune. Pay heed to the providing of nourishment and to what a person seeks to fill their own mouth with. Nourishment is everything. What you take in shapes you. What you give out reveals you. Pay heed to both. Perseverance brings good fortune—not the quick fix, but the steady attention to what sustains. Watch what you seek. Watch what you provide. This is how you know your path.",

    "You let your magic tortoise go, and look at me with the corners of your mouth drooping. Misfortune. You have the magic tortoise—the inner nourishment, the self-sufficiency—but you let it go. You look at others with drooping mouth, wanting what they have. This brings misfortune. You already have what you need. Stop looking outward.",
    "Turning to the summit for nourishment, deviating from the path to seek nourishment from the hill. Continuing to do this brings misfortune. You turn to the summit for nourishment—to those above, to external sources. You deviate from your path. This brings misfortune if you continue. The nourishment you seek is within. Stop looking up. Look in.",
    "Turning away from nourishment. Perseverance brings misfortune. Do not act thus for ten years. Nothing serves to further. You turn away from nourishment entirely. You deny yourself what you need. This brings misfortune. Do not act this way for ten years—do not make a practice of denial. Nothing furthers when you starve yourself. Eat. Drink. Be nourished.",
    "Turning to the summit for provision of nourishment brings good fortune. Spying about with sharp eyes like a tiger with insatiable craving. No blame. You turn to the summit for nourishment—but this time, it brings good fortune. You seek with sharp eyes, like a tiger with insatiable craving. This is no blame because the seeking is genuine. You are not begging; you are hunting. The nourishment you seek is worthy of the hunt.",
    "Turning away from the path. To remain persevering brings good fortune. One should not cross the great water. You turn away from the path—but remaining persevering brings good fortune.

    description: "Thunder below, mountain above. The thunder moves; the mountain is still. Between them, the mouth—the place of nourishment. This is the cycle of taking in and giving out. The thunder is the movement of seeking; the mountain is the stillness of digesting. Both are necessary. Without seeking, you starve. Without stillness, you cannot digest. Nourishment requires both."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The five colors blind the eye. The five tones deafen the ear. The five flavors dull the taste.' Hexagram 27 is the teaching of nourishment: to be mindful of what you take in. Not just food, but words, thoughts, images, company. All of it nourishes you. All of it shapes you. The sage is temperate—not from denial, but from wisdom. They know: you become what you consume. In your own life, pay heed to the corners of your mouth. What are you taking in? What are you giving out? Choose wisely. You are feeding your future with every bite, every word."
