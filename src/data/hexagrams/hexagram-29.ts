  heart: "Water above, water below. The abyss upon the abyss. This is danger—not the danger that passes, but the danger that is the path. Water flows into the depths, filling them, moving through them. It does not fight the abyss; it becomes the abyss. And in becoming, it finds its way through. This is the teaching of water: to flow through danger, not around it.",

  judgment: "The Abysmal repeated. If you are sincere, you have success in your heart, and whatever you do succeeds. The danger is not once; it is twice. The abyss upon the abyss. But if you are sincere—if your heart is true—you have success. Not because the danger disappears, but because you flow through it like water. Whatever you do succeeds because you are aligned with the nature of water: to fill, to flow, to find the way through.",
  image: "Water flows on uninterruptedly and reaches its goal. The image of the Abysmal repeated. The noble one walks in lasting virtue and carries on the business of teaching. Water flows on—it does not stop at the first abyss, or the second. It flows through. It reaches its goal. The noble one learns from this: to walk in lasting virtue, to carry on the business of teaching. Not once, but repeatedly. Not when it is easy, but when it is dangerous. This is the way of water.",

    "Repetition of the Abysmal. In the abyss, one falls into a pit. Misfortune. The abyss is repeated. You fall into a pit within the abyss. This is misfortune. The danger is deeper than you thought. But even here, even in the pit within the pit, the water flows. Do not stop. Flow.",
    "The abyss is dangerous. One should strive to attain small things only. The abyss is dangerous. Do not strive for great things now. Attain small things. Each small thing is a step through the danger. Do not underestimate the small. In the abyss, the small is the way through.",
    "Forward and backward, abyss on abyss. In danger like this, pause at first and wait, otherwise you will fall into a pit in the abyss. Do not help this. Forward and backward—abyss on abyss. The danger is all around. Pause. Wait. Do not rush. If you rush, you will fall into a pit. Do not help this—do not make it worse by your own haste. Wait. The water will show you the way.",
    "A jug of wine, a bowl of rice with it. Earthen vessels simply handed in through the window. There is certainly no blame in this. A jug of wine. A bowl of rice. Simple offerings, passed through the window. This is sincerity. This is what is needed in the abyss. Not grand gestures, not elaborate plans. Simple truth. Simple offering. There is no blame in this. There is only the way through.",
    "The abyss is not filled to overflowing, it is filled only to the rim. No blame. The abyss is not filled to overflowing—only to the rim. This is enough. Do not try to fill more. Do not try to overcome the danger completely. Fill only to the rim. This is no blame. This is wisdom. The water knows its level. You should too.",
    "Bound with cords and ropes, shut in between thorn-hedged prison walls. For three years one does not find the way. Misfortune. You are bound—cords, ropes, thorn-hedged walls. For three years, you do not find the way. This is misfortune. The danger has become prison. But even here, even in this binding, the water flows. Eventually, the water finds the crack. Eventually, the way opens. Wait. Flow. Do not stop."

    description: "Water above, water below. The abyss repeated. This is danger doubled—but it is also the way through doubled. Water does not fear the abyss; it flows through it. It fills the depths and moves on. This is the teaching of the abysmal: to flow through danger, not to avoid it. The water that stops becomes stagnant. The water that flows becomes the river. Be the river."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'Nothing in the world is as soft and yielding as water. Yet for dissolving the hard and inflexible, nothing can surpass it.' Hexagram 29 is water at its most dangerous—and its most powerful. The abyss upon the abyss. But water does not fear. It flows. It fills. It finds the way through. In your own danger, find this same quality. Do not fight the abyss. Flow through it. Do not stop. Do not stagnate. The water that keeps moving reaches the sea. You will too."
