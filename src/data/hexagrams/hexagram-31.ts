  heart: "Lake above, mountain below. The lake sinks toward the mountain; the mountain rises to meet it. This is influence: not the force that compels, but the attraction that draws. The mountain does not reach for the lake; the lake does not command the mountain. They simply move toward each other, as things do when they belong together. This is wooing: the mutual recognition that becomes union.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "咸。亨，利貞。取女吉。",
    rendering: "Influence. Success. Perseverance furthers. To take a wife brings good fortune."

  judgment: "Influence. Success. Perseverance furthers. To take a wife brings good fortune. Influence is mutual. It is not the one who acts upon the other; it is the two who move toward each other. Success follows because the movement is natural. Perseverance furthers—the influence deepens over time. To take a wife brings good fortune—the union is blessed. Not because it is perfect, but because it is true.",
  image: "A lake on the mountain. The image of Influence. The noble one encourages people to approach them by their readiness to receive them. The lake on the mountain: the water sinks, the mountain rises. They meet. The noble one learns from this: to encourage approach by readiness to receive. Not by reaching, not by demanding, but by being open. The mountain does not go to the lake; it is present. The lake comes. Be the mountain. Be present. They will come.",

    "The influence shows itself in the big toe. The influence is in the big toe—the lowest part, the beginning. It is small, but it is real. The movement has started. Do not underestimate the small beginning. The toe moves first; the body follows.",
    "The influence shows itself in the calves of the legs. Misfortune. Tarrying brings good fortune. The influence moves to the calves—the legs, the movement. But here, misfortune threatens. Why? Because you are moving too fast. Tarrying brings good fortune. Wait. Let the influence deepen. Do not rush the movement.",
    "The influence shows itself in the thighs. Holds to that which follows it. To continue is humiliating. The influence is in the thighs—the powerful muscles, the drive. You hold to what follows you—you are attached to the movement. To continue is humiliating. You are being led by your own desire. Stop. Let go. The influence should lead you, not you it.",
    "Perseverance brings good fortune. Remorse disappears. If a person is agitated in mind, and their thoughts go hither and thither, only those friends on whom they fix their conscious thoughts will follow. Perseverance brings good fortune. Remorse disappears. But if your mind is agitated, if your thoughts scatter, only those friends you fix your thoughts on will follow. The influence requires focus. Calm the mind. Fix your thoughts. The influence will deepen.",
    "The influence shows itself in the back of the neck. No remorse. The influence is in the back of the neck—the place of turning, of looking around. No remorse follows because you are aware. You are looking. You are turning. The influence is not blind. It sees.",
    "The influence shows itself in the jaws, cheeks, and tongue. The influence is in the jaws, cheeks, tongue—the place of words, of speech. This is the final stage: the influence has reached the mouth. What you say now matters. Speak truth. Speak from the influence. Do not speak from calculation. The words will carry the influence."

    description: "Mountain below, lake above. The mountain is still; the lake sinks. They move toward each other—not by force, but by attraction. This is influence: the mutual recognition that becomes union. The mountain does not reach; it is present. The lake does not command; it flows. Together, they meet. This is wooing: not the pursuit, but the mutual approach."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The sage stays behind, thus is ahead.' Hexagram 31 is the teaching of influence: to attract by being present, not by pursuing. The mountain does not chase the lake; it simply is. And the lake comes. In your own relationships, find this same quality. Do not chase. Do not demand. Be present. Be open. Let the influence work. Those who belong with you will come. The mountain does not worry. Neither should you."
