  heart: "Fire over water. The fire rises, the water sinks—they move apart, not yet in harmony. Before Completion is the final hexagram, the last of sixty-four, yet it points forward. Nothing is ever truly finished. After every completion, there is a new beginning. The young fox has almost crossed the stream, but its tail gets wet. Almost, but not yet. This is the human condition: always approaching, never fully arriving. And this is not failure; it is the way.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "未濟。亨。小狐汔濟，濡其尾，无攸利。",
    rendering: "Before Completion. Success. But the little fox, after almost crossing, gets its tail wet. Nothing that would further."
  },
  judgment: "Before completion, success is still possible—but not yet. The little fox almost crosses, then wets its tail. The crossing is not complete. Nothing furthers at this moment because the time is not ripe. Yet this hexagram is not despair; it is the most hopeful of all. It is the last, but it points to the first. After 63, before 64, the cycle begins again. The fire and water are separate, but they will meet. The fox will cross. Not now, but soon. Persevere in the approach; the completion will come.",
  image: "Fire over water. The noble one is careful in distinguishing things and giving them their places. Fire over water: they are separate, not yet in relation. The noble one learns: be careful in distinguishing things. Give them their places. Not yet union, but preparation. Know what each thing is, where it belongs, and the conditions for their meeting. Before completion, clarity is the foundation. When the time comes, you will be ready.",

    "He gets his tail wet. Humiliation. The first step, and already a mishap—the tail wet. Humiliation because the crossing is not yet successful. But it is only the tail; the fox itself is not submerged. A small failure, a lesson.",
    "He brakes his wheels. Perseverance brings good fortune. After the wet tail, slow down. Brake the wheels. Perseverance in this caution brings good fortune. The crossing can wait; better to arrive late than not at all.",
    "Before completion, setting forth brings misfortune. It furthers one to cross the great water. The warning: setting forth now, in haste, brings misfortune. Yet it furthers to cross the great water—the great task—but only when the time is right. Discernment is all.",
    "Perseverance brings good fortune. Regret disappears. Shock, thus to discipline the kingdom. For three years, invest in great regions. After the caution, after the waiting, perseverance brings good fortune. Regret disappears. Now use the shock—the energy—to discipline the kingdom, to invest in great regions. The time for action approaches.",
    "Perseverance brings good fortune. No regret. The light of the noble one is true. Good fortune. At the threshold: perseverance still brings good fortune, now without regret. The noble one's light is true—clear, steady. Good fortune because you are ready.",
    "He drinks wine. No blame. But if he gets his head wet, he loses it, in truth. The final line: at the very end, you may relax—drink wine. No blame in that. But if you get your head wet—if you go too far, lose yourself—you lose it, in truth. Before completion, even at the last step, stay aware. The crossing is almost done, but not yet. Do not drown at the shore."

    description: "Water below, fire above. They move apart, not yet in harmony. Before Completion is the state of potential, of approaching, of almost. The fire and water will meet—they always do. But not yet. The wise one in this state waits, prepares, and trusts the process. The crossing will be made. The cycle will continue."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The Tao is hidden and nameless. Yet it alone nourishes and completes all things.' Hexagram 64 is the hidden Tao, the completion that is not yet complete, the name that cannot be named. After sixty-three stages, we return to the beginning. The fox almost crosses; the cycle almost ends. But there is no end. The Tao flows on, eternally before completion, eternally approaching. The wise one does not demand arrival; they find peace in the approach, joy in the almost. The tail is wet, but the crossing continues. And that is enough."
