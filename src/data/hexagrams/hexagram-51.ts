  heart: "Thunder over thunder. The shock doubled, the awakening intensified. Thunder is the sudden movement that breaks stillness, the earthquake that shakes foundations, the lightning that illuminates darkness. The Arousing is not gentle; it is the wake-up call that cannot be ignored. But the shock is not punishment; it is the Tao's way of shaking you awake, of breaking the complacency that keeps you asleep. After the shock comes clarity. After the fear comes laughter.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "震。亨。震來虩虩，笑言啞啞。震驚百里，不喪匕鬯。",
    rendering: "Shock brings success. Shock comes—oh, oh! Then words of laughter. Shock travels a hundred miles, but the sacrificial spoon and chalice are not dropped."
  },
  judgment: "Shock brings success. The initial shock terrifies—oh, oh!—but then comes laughter, the release of tension, the recognition that you survived. The shock travels a hundred miles, shaking everything, but the sacrificial spoon and chalice are not dropped. The sacred is preserved through the chaos. Success comes to those who remain centered in the shock, who do not drop what matters. The Arousing is not your enemy; it is the force that wakes you up. Welcome it, and you will laugh after the fear.",
  image: "Thunder repeated. The image of Shock. The noble one in fear and trembling sets their life in order and examines themselves. Thunder repeated: the shock comes again and again. The noble one learns: do not wait for the shock to force change. In fear and trembling—aware of vulnerability—set your life in order. Examine yourself. The shock will come whether you are ready or not. Be ready before it arrives.",
  lines: [
    "Shock comes—oh, oh! Then words of laughter. Good fortune.",
    "Shock comes bringing danger. A hundred thousand times you lose your treasures and must climb the nine hills. Do not pursue them. On the seventh day you will get them back.",
    "Shock comes and makes one distraught. If shock spurs to action, one remains free of misfortune.",
    "Shock is mired.",
    "Shock goes hither and thither. Danger. However, nothing at all is lost. Yet there are things to be done.",
    "Shock brings ruin and terrified gazing around. Going ahead brings misfortune. If it has not yet touched one's own body but has reached one's neighbor first, there is no blame. One's comrades have something to talk about."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The sage manages affairs without action and conveys teachings without words.' Hexagram 51 is the exception: sometimes action is required, sometimes words must be shouted. The shock is the Tao's way of breaking through complacency. The wise one does not resist the shock; they let it wake them up. After the fear, laughter. After the shaking, stillness."
