  heart: "Thunder rolling, rolling—shock after shock. It terrifies, then it passes. The Arousing is the moment of crisis, the sudden event that shatters complacency. The wise one does not run from the shock; they meet it with inner stillness. The thunder comes, the thunder goes, and they remain.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "震。亨。震來虩虩，笑言啞啞。震驚百里，不喪匕鬯。",
    rendering: "The Arousing brings success. Shock comes, oh, oh! Then laughter, ha, ha! The terror terrifies a hundred miles, yet he does not let fall the ladle and the sacred wine."
  },
  judgment: "Success comes through shock. When the thunder rolls, the unprepared are scattered, but the prepared hold steady. The ladle of sacred wine does not spill; the offering continues. In crisis, your practice is tested. If you have cultivated stillness, you will not be shaken. The laughter after the shock is not mockery; it is the relief of one who remained centered. Let the thunder come. You will still be holding what is sacred.",
  image: "Thunder repeated. The noble one fears and examines himself. Thunder after thunder—shock upon shock. The noble one learns: fear, but not panic. Examine yourself. In the moment of crisis, look inward. What is still unsteady in you? What might the thunder reveal? Use the shock as a mirror, and you will emerge stronger.",
  lines: [
    "Shock comes, oh, oh! Then laughter, ha, ha! Good fortune. The first shock terrifies, then passes. Laughter follows—not because the danger was trivial, but because you survived it. Good fortune because you are still here.",
    "Shock comes, bringing danger. A hundred thousand times you lose your treasures. Climb the nine hills. Do not pursue. The shock brings loss—treasures scattered. Do not chase them. Climb to high ground, gain perspective. What is truly yours will return, or you will see it was never yours.",
    "Shock comes and leaves you dazed. If the shock activates you, you remain free of misfortune. Dazed, disoriented—but if the shock also activates you, moves you, you will be free of misfortune. Let the shock wake you, not just stun you.",
    "Shock bogs down. The shock is mired, stuck—not fully expressed. This is its own kind of danger. The energy cannot move; it festers. If you find yourself in this bogged state, wait. The shock will either release or dissolve. Do not force it.",
    "Shock comes, going and coming. Danger. Nonetheless, you lose nothing. But there are things to do. The shock oscillates, comes and goes. Danger remains. Yet you lose nothing essential. There are things to do—attend to them. The shock is now background, not foreground.",
    "Shock brings ruin and terrified gazing. Setting forth brings misfortune. If the shock has not reached you but your neighbor, there is no blame. Your companions have something to talk about. The worst shock: ruin, paralysis. To set forth now brings misfortune. But if the shock spares you and strikes your neighbor, there is no blame. Grieve with them, help them, but do not take their shock as your own."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'If you realize that all things change, there is nothing you will try to hold on to.' Hexagram 51 is the teaching of impermanence made violent. Thunder comes, thunder goes. The sacred wine does not spill—not because the hand is rigid, but because it is so present that even shock cannot disrupt it. The sage, like the hand that holds the ladle, is not shaken because they are not attached. Let the thunder roll. You are already home."
