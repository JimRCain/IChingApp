  heart: "Earth above, thunder below. The thunder stirs beneath the earth—the first stirring of yang after the dark of winter. This is return: not the triumphant arrival, but the quiet turning, the first breath after holding, the first light after the longest night. One yang line returns beneath five yin lines. It is small, but it is everything. The turning point has come.",

    chinese: "復。亨。出入无疾，朋來无咎。反復其道，七日來復，利有攸往。",

  judgment: "Return. Success. Going out and coming in without error. Friends come without blame. To and fro goes the way. On the seventh day comes return. It furthers one to have somewhere to go. The dark has reached its peak. The light returns. This is the natural rhythm—seven days, seven phases, seven steps. The turning is not sudden; it is prepared. When return comes, do not hesitate. Go somewhere. Move with the new energy. It is small, but it is the beginning of everything.",
  image: "Thunder within the earth. The image of the Turning Point. Thus the ancient kings closed the passes at the time of solstice. Merchants and strangers did not go about, and the ruler did not travel through the provinces. Thunder within the earth: the stirring is there, but it is not yet time for it to emerge. The ancient kings understood this. At the solstice—the turning point—they closed the passes. They did not push outward. They waited. They let the new energy gather. This is the wisdom of return: do not rush the beginning. Let it strengthen. Then move.",

    "Return from a short distance. No need for remorse. Great good fortune. You have not gone far from your true path. The return is easy. No remorse is needed. This is great good fortune—recognizing the turning while the distance is still small. Do not mistake this for failure. It is wisdom.",
    "Quiet return. Good fortune. The return is quiet—no fanfare, no announcement. You simply turn. This brings good fortune because the return is genuine. It is not performed for others. It is done for yourself. The quiet turning is the deepest turning.",
    "Repeated return. Danger. No blame. You return, you leave, you return again. This is dangerous—the back and forth weakens you. But there is no blame. You are learning. The return is real, even if it is not yet steady. Keep returning. Eventually, you will stay.",
    "Walking in the midst of others, you return alone. You walk with others, but you return alone. This is the return that separates you from the crowd. You see what they do not see. You turn when they do not turn. This is lonely, but it is true. Do not mistake loneliness for wrongness.",
    "Noble-hearted return. No remorse. The return is noble-hearted—generous, open, without smallness. You return not for gain, but for truth. This brings no remorse. You have turned toward what is real. Nothing more is needed.",
    "Missing the return. Misfortune. Calamity from within and without. If armies are set marching in this way, one will in the end suffer a great defeat, disastrous for the ruler of the country. For ten years it will not be possible to attack again. You have missed the return. The turning point has passed. This is misfortune—calamity from within and without. If you act now, if you march armies, you will be defeated. For ten years, you cannot attack again. The timing is everything. You missed it. Wait. Gather. Do not force."

    description: "Earth above, thunder below. The thunder stirs beneath the earth—the first yang returning after the winter solstice. This is the turning point: the dark has peaked, the light returns. The thunder is small—one line—but it is the beginning of everything. The earth contains it, protects it, lets it gather strength. This is return: the quiet stirring that becomes the great movement."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'Returning is the motion of the Tao.' Hexagram 24 is this returning made visible. The Tao does not move in a straight line; it moves in circles. It returns. The seasons return. The breath returns. The heart returns. In your own life, do not fear the return. It is not going backward; it is going deeper. The thunder beneath the earth does not rush. It gathers. It strengthens. And when it emerges, it emerges as spring. You are at the turning point. The light is returning. Do not force it. Do not rush it. Let it gather. Then move."
