  heart: "Heaven above, thunder below. The thunder rolls under heaven—spontaneous, unexpected, without calculation. This is innocence: not the ignorance of the naive, but the clarity of the uncalculated. The unexpected comes not from planning, but from alignment. When you act without ulterior motive, without scheme, without the weight of expectation, you are innocent. And in that innocence, heaven moves through you.",

    chinese: "无妄。元亨利貞。其匪正有眚，不利有攸往。",
    rendering: "Innocence. Supreme success. Perseverance furthers. If someone is not as he should be, he has misfortune, and it does not further him to undertake anything."

  judgment: "Innocence. Supreme success. Perseverance furthers. If someone is not as he should be, he has misfortune, and it does not further him to undertake anything. Innocence is not something you achieve; it is something you return to. When you act from this place, supreme success follows. But if you are not as you should be—if you act from calculation, from scheme, from false motive—misfortune comes. Do not undertake anything from that place. Return to innocence first.",
  image: "Under heaven thunder rolls. All things attain the natural state of innocence. Thus the ancient kings, in harmony with this time, developed and nourished all beings. Under heaven, thunder rolls—spontaneous, unexpected, without design. All things respond in their natural state. The ancient kings understood this. They did not force growth; they developed and nourished. They did not command life; they allowed it. This is innocence: to act without forcing, to lead without controlling, to be without pretense.",

    "Innocent behavior brings good fortune. The behavior is innocent—without calculation, without scheme. This brings good fortune because it is aligned with the natural order. You do not try to be innocent; you simply are. And in that being, good fortune comes.",
    "If one does not count on the harvest while plowing, nor on the use of the ground while clearing it, it furthers one to undertake something. You plow without counting the harvest. You clear without counting the use. This is innocence: to act without attachment to outcome. When you undertake from this place, everything furthers. The work is its own reward.",
    "Undeserved misfortune. The cow that was tethered by someone is the wanderer's gain, the citizen's loss. Misfortune comes that you do not deserve. Like the cow that was tethered—someone else's cow—becomes the wanderer's gain, the citizen's loss. You are the citizen. You lose. This is not your fault. It is the nature of things. Do not cling to what is lost. Let it go.",
    "He who can be persevering remains without blame. If one is persevering in what is right, misfortune comes from without. You are persevering in what is right. You are innocent. But misfortune comes anyway—from without, from outside. This is not a sign of wrong. It is the nature of the world. Remain without blame. Do not let the outer misfortune corrupt your inner innocence.",
    "Use no medicine in an illness incurred through no fault of your own. It will pass of itself. The illness is not your fault. It came from without. Do not use medicine. Do not try to fix what is not yours to fix. It will pass of itself. This is the wisdom of innocence: to know when not to act, when to let the natural order heal.",
    "Innocent action brings misfortune. Nothing furthers. The action is innocent, but misfortune comes. Nothing furthers. This is the hardest teaching: sometimes innocence is not enough. The timing is wrong. The world is not ready. Do not force. Wait. The innocence is still yours. The misfortune is not a judgment. It is a sign: not now."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The sage does not attempt anything very big. Thus he achieves greatness.' Hexagram 25 is the teaching of innocence: to act without trying to be great, to move without calculation, to be without pretense. The thunder does not try to be loud; it simply rolls. Heaven does not try to be high; it simply is. In your own life, find this same innocence. Do not scheme. Do not calculate. Act from alignment, and the action will be true. The harvest will come, but do not count it while plowing. The work is enough."
