  heart: "Wind over water. Wind scatters the clouds, disperses the mist. Dispersion is the breaking up of what has become stagnant—rigid thoughts, frozen feelings, blocked energy. Not destruction, but release. The wind does not destroy the water; it moves it, clears it, refreshes it. In human life, dispersion comes when we need to let go, to forgive, to release what no longer serves. The wise one welcomes the wind that clears the heart.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "渙。亨。王假有廟，利涉大川，利貞。",
    rendering: "Dispersion. Success. The king approaches his temple. It furthers one to cross the great water. Perseverance furthers."
  },
  judgment: "Dispersion brings success because it clears the way. The king approaches his temple—the center, the sacred—after the dispersion of what distracted him. It furthers one to cross the great water—the great difficulty—because the obstacles have been scattered. Perseverance in this clearing furthers all things. Do not cling to what must disperse. Let the wind do its work, and you will find yourself lighter, clearer, ready for the crossing.",
  image: "Wind over water. The ancient kings sacrificed to the Lord and built temples. Wind over water: the wind moves the water, clears the surface. The ancient kings learned: sacrifice to the Lord—offer thanks for the clearing. Build temples—create spaces where the sacred can be encountered. Dispersion is not just loss; it is the condition for new connection. After the scattering, gather at the temple.",

    "He brings help with strong horses. Good fortune. At the first sign of dispersion, strong horses—energy, resources—arrive to help. Good fortune because you are supported. The dispersion is not abandonment; it is redistribution.",
    "During dispersion, he hurries to his support. Regret disappears. When the scattering begins, hurry to what supports you—friends, practice, truth. Regret disappears because you do not wait until you are scattered too far.",
    "He disperses his own self. No regret. The deepest dispersion: letting go of the self, the ego, the fixed identity. No regret because what remains is more real than what was lost. The self was the last obstacle.",
    "He disperses his group. Great good fortune. The group—the tribe, the identity—disperses. This seems like loss, but it is great good fortune because the group was a barrier to larger connection. After dispersion, you can belong to all.",
    "Dispersion leads to sweaty announcements. Perseverance brings good fortune. The dispersion is so intense that it produces sweat—effort, release. Announcements—truths that must be spoken—come forth. Perseverance in this sweaty clearing brings good fortune.",
    "He disperses the blood. Dispersing, leaving, departing—no blame. Blood—the deepest ties, the most visceral bonds. To disperse even these, to leave, to depart—no blame because some bonds must be released for life to continue. The final line acknowledges the hardest letting go."

    description: "Water below, wind above. Wind over water—the surface stirs, the mist clears. Dispersion is this: the gentle force that moves what is stagnant, that breaks up what has frozen. The water does not resist; it ripples. The wind does not force; it moves. Together, they create clarity."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'To obtain, one must first give. To learn, one must first unlearn.' Hexagram 59 is the great unlearning, the great giving away. Dispersion is not loss; it is the clearing that allows new growth. The wind that scatters the clouds also reveals the sun. The sage who lets go of the self finds the true self. In dispersion, there is no blame—only the spaciousness of a heart that has released its hold."
