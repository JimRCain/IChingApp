  heart: "Wind below, mountain above. The wind blows against the mountain, but the mountain does not move. Instead, the wind works on what has been spoiled—rotting leaves, dead branches, the decay that accumulates when things are left unattended. This is not destruction; it is restoration. The wind does not blame the mountain for the decay; it simply works, steadily, clearing what needs to be cleared. Work on what has been spoiled is not punishment; it is care.",

    chinese: "蠱。元亨，利涉大川。先甲三日，後甲三日。",
    rendering: "Work on What Has Been Spoiled has supreme success. It furthers one to cross the great water. Before the starting point, three days. After the starting point, three days."

  judgment: "Work on What Has Been Spoiled has supreme success. It furthers one to cross the great water. Before the starting point, three days. After the starting point, three days. Something has been spoiled—by neglect, by error, by the slow decay of time. This is not a cause for despair but for work. Supreme success is possible, but it requires preparation. Before the starting point, three days: prepare, understand, gather your strength. After the starting point, three days: consolidate, stabilize, ensure the work holds. The crossing of the great water is possible, but only if you honor the timing.",
  image: "The wind blows low on the mountain. The image of Decay. Thus the noble one stirs up the people and strengthens their spirit. The wind at the base of the mountain: this is where the decay gathers, in the low places, the unseen places. The noble one looks at this and understands: the work is not to blame, but to stir up. To move what has stagnated. To strengthen the spirit of the people so they can do the work themselves. This is restoration: not the leader doing everything, but the leader awakening the capacity in others.",

    "Setting right what has been spoiled by the father. If there is a son, no blame rests upon the departed father. Danger. In the end, good fortune. The spoilage came from the father—from the previous generation, the previous way. You, the son, set it right. No blame rests on the father; they did what they could with what they knew. But you know differently. There is danger in this work—you are challenging what came before. But in the end, good fortune. The father is honored by your improvement.",
    "Setting right what has been spoiled by the mother. One must not be too persevering. The spoilage came from the mother—from the nurturing, the holding, the containing. To set this right, you must be gentle. Too much perseverance, too much force, and you damage what was meant with love. Be firm, but be tender. The work is correction, not rejection.",
    "Setting right what has been spoiled by the father. There will be a little remorse. No great blame. You set right what the father spoiled. There will be a little remorse—some pain, some loss, some grief for what must be changed. But no great blame. You are doing what is necessary. The remorse is not a sign of wrong; it is a sign of care. You are not destroying; you are restoring.",
    "Tolerating what has been spoiled by the father. In continuing one sees humiliation. You tolerate the spoilage. You do not set it right. In continuing this way, you see humiliation—not because you are weak, but because you are avoiding the work. The spoilage will not fix itself. To tolerate it is to be complicit in it. Move. Act. Restore.",
    "Setting right what has been spoiled by the father. One meets with praise. You set right what the father spoiled, and you meet with praise. Not because you sought it, but because the work itself is praiseworthy. You have restored what was broken. You have honored the father by improving on their work. This is the highest form of respect: to take what was given and make it better.",
    "He does not serve kings and princes. He sets himself higher goals. You are not working for kings and princes—not for external authority, not for reward or recognition. You set yourself higher goals: the work itself, the restoration itself, the truth itself. This is the peak of work on what has been spoiled: when the work is its own reward, when the restoration is its own purpose. Serve the work, and the work will serve the world."

    description: "Wind below, mountain above. The wind works at the base of the mountain, where the decay gathers. The mountain does not move; it simply is. The wind does not stop; it simply works. This is the nature of restoration: the steady, patient work of clearing, of stirring up, of strengthening. The mountain provides the form; the wind provides the movement. Together, they create the conditions for renewal."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The Tao never acts, yet nothing is left undone.' Hexagram 18 seems to contradict this—it is all about action, about work, about setting right. But look deeper. The wind does not force; it penetrates. It does not command; it moves. It does not blame; it clears. This is the Taoist way of work: to act without forcing, to correct without condemning, to restore without claiming. The father's spoilage is not a sin; it is a condition. The son's work is not a judgment; it is a service. In your own work on what has been spoiled, find this same spirit. Do not blame the past; learn from it. Do not claim the future; serve it. The wind does not take credit for the cleared leaves. It simply blows. And the mountain, unchanged, stands."
