  heart: "Mountain above, earth below. The mountain crumbles into the earth. This is splitting apart: not the sudden crash, but the slow erosion, the gradual falling away of what can no longer hold. The upper lines are yang, but they are being worn down by the yin below. This is not disaster; it is the natural cycle. What is false falls away. What is real remains.",

  judgment: "Splitting Apart. It does not further one to go anywhere. When the foundation is eroding, when the structure is crumbling, this is not the time for great undertakings. The small people are ascending; the noble one withdraws. This is not cowardice; it is wisdom. Do not try to hold what is already falling. Let it split apart. What is true will survive. What is false was never yours to keep.",
  image: "The mountain rests on the earth. The image of Splitting Apart. Those above secure their position only by giving generously to those below. The mountain is high, but without the earth, it cannot stand. Those in power learn from this: to secure their position, they must give to those below, not take from them. When the foundation is strong, the mountain stands. When the foundation is neglected, the mountain crumbles.",

    "The leg of the bed is split. Those who persevere are destroyed. Misfortune. The splitting begins at the bottom—the leg of the bed, the foundation. If you try to persevere in this, you will be destroyed. The structure is already failing. Do not cling to it. Recognize the danger. Move.",
    "The bed is split at the edge. Those who persevere are destroyed. Misfortune. The splitting continues—it has reached the edge of the bed. Still, if you try to hold on, you will be destroyed. The erosion is spreading. Do not mistake this for a small problem. It is the whole structure that is failing.",
    "He splits with them. No blame. Here, you join the splitting. You do not try to hold what is falling. You let go. This brings no blame because you are not betraying; you are recognizing truth. Sometimes the most faithful act is to let something die.",
    "The bed is split up to the skin. Misfortune. The splitting has reached the skin—the surface, the last protection. This is misfortune because you have waited too long. You should have let go earlier. Now the damage is deep. But even now, it is not too late to release.",
    "A shoal of fishes. Favor comes through the court ladies. Everything acts to further. The fish swim together—a school, a community. Favor comes through those who serve, who hold the space. When the splitting is complete, something new can begin. Everything furthers because the false has fallen away. The ground is clear.",
    "There is a large fruit still uneaten. The noble one receives a carriage. The house of the inferior person is split apart. The fruit remains—the seed, the essence, what cannot be destroyed. The noble one receives honor—a carriage, recognition. The house of the inferior person splits apart. This is the completion: the false falls, the true remains, and those who held truth are honored."

    description: "Earth below, mountain above. The earth erodes; the mountain crumbles. This is splitting apart: the foundation giving way, the structure falling. The mountain cannot stand without the earth. When the earth is weakened, the mountain must fall. This is not punishment; it is nature. What is built on sand returns to sand."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail.' Hexagram 23 is the teaching of letting go. The mountain is hard, stiff, unmoving—and so it splits apart. The earth is soft, yielding, receptive—and so it remains. In your own life, when something is splitting apart, do not try to hold it. The Tao does not cling. It flows. What is meant for you will not split apart. What splits apart was never yours. Let it fall. The earth will receive it. And from that earth, something new will grow."
