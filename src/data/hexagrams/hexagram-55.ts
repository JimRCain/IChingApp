  heart: "Thunder over fire. Thunder rolls above, fire burns below—both are movement, both are brightness. Abundance is this: the peak of power, the height of influence, the moment when everything is possible. But the sun at noon must begin to set. Abundance contains its own decline. The wise one in abundance does not become arrogant; they remain aware that all peaks are temporary.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "豐。亨，王假之，勿憂，宜日中。",
    rendering: "Abundance has success. The king attains it. Do not grieve. Be like the sun at midday."
  },
  judgment: "Abundance brings success. The king attains it—those in positions of power can use abundance for great good. Do not grieve the passing nature of abundance; instead, be like the sun at midday. Shine fully while you can. Give generously while you have much. The sun does not hoard its light; it radiates without reservation. In abundance, do the same. Do not worry about the coming decline; worry only about whether you used your abundance well.",
  image: "Thunder and fire. The noble one decides lawsuits and carries out punishments. Thunder and fire: both are clear, both are decisive. The noble one learns: in times of abundance, justice must be clear. Decide lawsuits with clarity. Carry out punishments with certainty. Abundance gives you the power to act decisively; use it to establish order, not to indulge whim. The sun at midday casts no shadows; your justice should be the same.",

    "When a man meets his destined ruler, they can be together ten days, and it is not a mistake. Going meets with recognition. In abundance, you meet your destined ruler—the one you are meant to serve, to work with. Ten days together is not too long; it is right. Going meets with recognition because the timing is perfect. Abundance brings the right people together.",
    "The curtain is of such fullness that the polestars can be seen at noon. Through going, one meets with mistrust and hate. If one rouses him through truth, good fortune comes. The curtain is so full it blocks the sun—stars visible at noon. This is abundance turned to darkness. Going meets mistrust because others cannot see clearly. But if you rouse them through truth, good fortune comes. Even in darkness, truth can pierce through.",
    "The underbrush is of such abundance that the small stars can be seen at noon. He breaks his right arm. No blame. The underbrush grows so thick it obscures vision—small stars at noon. He breaks his right arm—the instrument of action is disabled. But no blame because the breaking is not his fault. In abundance, sometimes you are rendered powerless by the very fullness around you. Wait for clarity to return.",
    "The curtain is of such fullness that the polestars can be seen at noon. He meets his ruler, who is of like kind. Good fortune. Again, the curtain blocks the sun. But now, he meets his ruler—someone of like kind, someone who sees as he sees. This brings good fortune because in the darkness, they recognize each other. Abundance can isolate, but it can also bring together those who share vision.",
    "Lines are coming. Blessing and fame draw near. Good fortune. The lines—the patterns, the connections—are forming. Blessing and fame draw near not because you sought them, but because abundance naturally attracts attention. Good fortune if you receive them with humility. Do not claim the blessing as your doing; it is the season's gift.",
    "His house is in a state of abundance. He screens off his family. He peers through the gate and no longer perceives anyone. For three years he sees nothing. Misfortune. The house is abundant, but he screens off his family—isolates himself in his wealth. He peers through the gate and sees nothing. For three years, nothing. This is the danger of abundance: to become so enclosed in your own fullness that you see no one, nothing. Misfortune follows because abundance without connection is emptiness."

    description: "Fire below, thunder above. Fire burns bright; thunder rolls loud. Both are at their peak. This is abundance: the moment of maximum power, maximum visibility, maximum influence. But fire consumes its fuel; thunder passes. The wise one knows: abundance is a season, not a state."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'When gold and jade fill your hall, you will not be able to keep them safe. To be proud with honor and wealth is to cause one's own downfall. Retire when your work is done; this is the way of heaven.' Hexagram 55 is the teaching of abundance: it comes, it goes. The sun at midday cannot stay at midday. The wise one does not cling to abundance; they use it well, then let it pass. When your work is done, retire. When your hall is full, give away. This is how you remain aligned with the Tao, which never fills, never overflows, but flows eternally."
