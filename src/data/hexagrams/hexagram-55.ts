  heart: "Thunder over fire. Thunder rolls, fire burns—the height of power, the peak of influence. Abundance is fullness, prosperity, the moment when everything is present. But the hexagram warns: abundance does not last. The sun must set, the moon must wane. In times of abundance, the wise one does not grasp; they give. They do not cling; they share. For fullness, rightly used, becomes blessing. Hoarded, it becomes poison.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "豐。亨。王假之，勿憂，宜日中。",
    rendering: "Abundance has success. The king attains abundance. Do not grieve. Be like the sun at midday."
  },
  judgment: "Success comes with abundance, but it is not for you alone. The king attains it, but he must use it for all. Do not grieve that abundance cannot last; that is its nature. Be like the sun at midday—at its peak, it gives most light. It does not hoard its rays. In your abundance, give. In your fullness, share. The sun does not grieve that it must set; it shines fully while it can. So too, you.",
  image: "Thunder over fire. The noble one decides lawsuits and carries out punishments. Thunder over fire: the flash reveals, the shock enforces. The noble one learns: in times of abundance, clarity and justice are possible. Decide lawsuits—bring resolution. Carry out punishments—maintain order. Abundance is not just for enjoyment; it is for right action. Use your fullness to set things right.",
  lines: [
    "When you meet your match, you are alike. Even if you are of no account, there is no blame. Going forward brings honor. In abundance, you meet your match—one who shares your quality. Even if you are humble, this meeting is without blame. Go forward; honor awaits.",
    "The screen is so full of light that you see a speck. Going forward brings doubt. With goodwill and sacrifice, good fortune. So much light that it obscures; you see a speck, a flaw. Doubt arises. But with goodwill and sacrifice—with sincere offering—good fortune follows. Do not let the flaw blind you to the whole.",
    "The underbrush is so thick that you see a small speck. Not seeing the big person. In abundance, obscurity can come from excess—too much, and you miss the essential. Not seeing the big person because the small fills your vision. The line warns: clear the underbrush.",
    "The screen is so full of light that you see a speck. You meet the big person. Good fortune. Again the light obscures, but now you meet the big person—the one who sees through the glare. Good fortune because recognition transcends the excess.",
    "Lines are coming. Blessing and fame draw near. Good fortune. Abundance at its peak: lines converge, blessings arrive, fame approaches. Good fortune because you are ready to receive without grasping.",
    "His house is in a state of abundance. He screens off his family. He peers through the gate and no longer perceives anyone. For three years he sees nothing. Misfortune. Abundance misused: he screens off his family, isolates himself. Peers through the gate and sees no one. For three years, a full cycle, he sees nothing. Misfortune because abundance became a prison. Do not let your fullness separate you from others."

    description: "Fire below, thunder above. Light and sound together—the peak of manifestation. Abundance is this: the full expression of power, the complete display of wealth. But the wise one knows that thunder fades and fire dims. In abundance, be generous; in fullness, be humble."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'To hold and fill to overflowing is not as good as to stop. To sharpen a blade and keep it too sharp cannot be kept long.' Hexagram 55 is the overflowing cup, the too-sharp blade. Abundance is a gift, but only if you know when to stop. The sun at midday gives most light, but it also begins its descent. The sage in abundance does not try to prolong it; they use it while it lasts, and let it go when it passes. In this, they are like the sun: full, generous, and unafraid of the setting."
