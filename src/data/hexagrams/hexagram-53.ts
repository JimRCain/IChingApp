  heart: "Tree over mountain. The tree grows on the mountain, slowly, steadily, year after year. Development is gradual progress—not a leap, but a steady ascent. The wild goose flies step by step, from shore to shore, never rushing, never stopping. In human life, true growth is like this: patient, persistent, inevitable. Do not force; just continue.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "漸。女歸吉，利貞。",
    rendering: "Development. The maiden is given in marriage. Good fortune. Perseverance furthers."
  },
  judgment: "The wild goose flies from shore to shore, each step measured, each resting place earned. Development is not a leap but a pilgrimage. The maiden goes to her new home not in haste but in trust, knowing that what is built slowly endures. Perseverance in this gradual approach brings good fortune because you are not skipping the steps that make the destination meaningful. Do not despise the slow days; they are the ones that carry you farthest.",
  image: "Tree over mountain. The noble one abides in clarity and moves with patience. Tree over mountain: it grows slowly, shaping the stone over eons. The noble one learns: abide in clarity—know where you are going. Move with patience—accept that the journey takes time. The mountain does not resent the tree's slow growth; it becomes a masterpiece of life. Your character, too, is being shaped by forces you cannot see. Trust the process.",

    "The wild goose gradually draws near the shore. The young son is in danger. There is talk. No blame. First step: approach the shore. There is danger—the son is young, inexperienced. There is talk—gossip, concern. But no blame because the movement is natural. Continue.",
    "The wild goose gradually draws near the cliff. Eating and drinking in peace and concord. Good fortune. Second step: the cliff, a resting place. Eating and drinking in peace—replenishment. Good fortune because you take time to gather strength. Do not rush past the resting places.",
    "The wild goose gradually draws near the plateau. The husband goes forth and does not return. The wife is pregnant but does not give birth. Misfortune. You might take robbers for a good cause. Third step: the plateau, exposed. The husband leaves and does not return—separation. The wife is pregnant but does not give birth—potential unfulfilled. Misfortune because the timing is off. You may mistake robbers for good people—trust the wrong thing. Pause and reassess.",
    "The wild goose gradually draws near the tree. It may light on a branch. No blame. Fourth step: the tree, a higher perch. It may light on a branch—not the top, not the bottom, just a place to rest. No blame because it is enough for now. Development does not demand the peak at every stage.",
    "The wild goose gradually draws near the summit. For three years the wife has no child. In the end nothing can oppose her. Good fortune. Fifth step: near the summit. For three years, no child—long patience, no visible result. But in the end, nothing can oppose her. Good fortune because perseverance has built a momentum that cannot be stopped.",
    "The wild goose gradually draws near the cloud heights. Its feathers can be used for the sacred dance. Good fortune. Final step: the cloud heights, the highest stage. The feathers—what was once just for flight—are now sacred, used in the dance. Good fortune because development has transformed the ordinary into the holy. The journey itself becomes the offering."

    description: "Mountain below, tree above. The tree grows on the mountain slowly, grain by grain. Development is this patient transformation: not a flood, but a steady growth. The mountain does not resist; it yields over time. The wise one learns that true change is gradual, and that which endures is built slowly."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The journey of a thousand miles begins under your feet.' Hexagram 53 is the journey itself, step by step, day by day. The wild goose does not leap to the clouds; it flies from shore to shore, resting when needed, pressing on when ready. The sage does not seek enlightenment in a flash; they cultivate it slowly, patiently, with the certainty of water wearing down stone. In the end, the feathers become sacred—not because they were special, but because they were faithful."
