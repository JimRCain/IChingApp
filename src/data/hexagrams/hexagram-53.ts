  heart: "Wind over wood. The tree grows slowly, invisibly, steadily. Development is this: the gradual progress that cannot be rushed. The tree does not try to grow fast; it simply grows, season by season, year by year. In human life, Development is the patient cultivation of what matters: relationships, skills, character, wisdom. These things cannot be forced; they unfold in their own time. The wise one does not rush development; they trust the process, knowing that what grows slowly grows strong.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "漸。女歸吉，利貞。",
    rendering: "Development. The marriage of the maiden brings good fortune. Perseverance furthers."
  },
  judgment: "Development. The marriage of the maiden brings good fortune. Perseverance furthers. The maiden does not rush to marriage; she develops gradually, step by step, through the proper stages. So too, all true development follows its own rhythm. Perseverance in this gradual process furthers all things. Do not try to skip stages; do not try to force growth. Trust the process. What develops gradually develops surely. The tree that grows slowly withstands the storm. The relationship that develops gradually withstands time.",
  image: "On the mountain, a tree. The image of Development. The noble one abides in dignity and virtue, in order to improve the mores. On the mountain, a tree: growing slowly, visibly, steadily. The noble one learns: abide in dignity and virtue. Not flashy, not hurried, but steady. Improve the mores—the customs, the culture, the way things are done. This cannot be rushed. Like the tree on the mountain, you grow slowly, and in growing, you improve the landscape.",

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.' Hexagram 53 is the teaching of gradual development. The tree does not hurry; it grows. The seasons do not rush; they turn. The wise one does not force development; they trust the process. What grows slowly grows strong. What develops gradually endures."
