  number: 15,
  name: "Modesty (謙 - Qiān)",
  heart: "Earth above, mountain below. The mountain, the highest thing, hides beneath the earth. This is modesty: not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less. The mountain does not need to show its height; it simply is high. The earth covers it, and in being covered, the mountain becomes more, not less. True greatness does not announce itself.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "謙。亨，君子有終。",
    rendering: "Modesty creates success. The noble one carries through to the end."
  },
  judgment: "Modesty creates success. The noble one carries through to the end. This is the only hexagram where every line is favorable. Why? Because modesty is the virtue that makes all other virtues possible. Without it, strength becomes arrogance, wisdom becomes pride, success becomes hubris. With it, you can carry anything through to the end. The modest one does not need to win; they need to be true. And in that truth, they succeed.",
  image: "Within the earth, a mountain. The image of Modesty. The noble one reduces that which is too much, and augments that which is too little. They weigh things and make them equal. The mountain is high, but it hides within the earth. The earth is low, but it covers the mountain. The noble one learns from this: to reduce what is excessive, to augment what is lacking, to weigh and balance. Not to flatten, but to equalize. Not to humble yourself falsely, but to find the true weight of things.",
  lines: [
    "A noble one modest about their modesty. They may cross the great water. Good fortune. This is modesty about modesty itself. You do not even claim your humility. You simply are humble. With this, you can cross the great water—the great difficulty—because you do not make yourself a target. Good fortune follows naturally.",
    "Modesty that comes to expression. Perseverance brings good fortune. Your modesty is not hidden; it shows in your actions, your words, your bearing. But it is not performed; it is genuine. This expressed modesty, if persevered in, brings good fortune. People trust what is real.",
    "A noble one of modesty and merit carries things to conclusion. Good fortune. You have merit—real accomplishment, real skill, real worth. But you are modest about it. You do not hide your merit; you simply do not make it the center. This balance allows you to carry things to conclusion. Good fortune follows because you are both capable and trustworthy.",
    "Nothing that would not further modesty in movement. Every movement you make is touched by modesty. Not hesitation, not self-doubt, but the lightness of one who does not need to prove anything. In this state, nothing fails to further. You can act freely because you are not acting for yourself.",
    "No boasting of wealth before one's neighbor. It is favorable to attack with force. Nothing that would not further. You have wealth—resources, power, capability. But you do not boast of it before your neighbor. This restraint gives you strength. When you must act, you can act with force, because your force is not tainted by arrogance. Nothing fails to further.",
    "Modesty that comes to expression. It is favorable to set armies marching to chastise one's own city and one's country. The highest form of modesty is not just personal; it is collective. You bring modesty to your own city, your own country. You chastise not the enemy without, but the arrogance within. This is favorable because it is true correction. Armies marching for modesty are armies in service of balance."

    description: "Mountain below, earth above. The mountain is high, but it is covered by the earth. This is the image of modesty: greatness that does not show itself. The mountain does not cease to be a mountain because it is covered; it simply does not need to prove it. The earth does not cease to be low because it covers the high; it simply does what is natural. Together, they create the landscape of true humility."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The sage stays behind, thus is ahead. Stays outside, thus is inside. Has no self, thus is fulfilled.' Hexagram 15 is the living of this teaching. The mountain stays below, and thus is the foundation. The earth stays above, and thus completes the form. Neither competes; both are fulfilled. In your own life, modesty is not self-erasure. It is self-placement. You know where you belong, and you belong there fully. The sage does not try to be ahead; they simply stay behind, and find themselves leading. The mountain does not try to be seen; it simply is, and the earth reveals it by covering it. This is the paradox of modesty: to be covered is to be revealed. To stay behind is to arrive."
