  heart: "Thunder above, earth below. The thunder rolls across the earth, and everything stirs. This is enthusiasm: not the shallow excitement of the moment, but the deep resonance that moves the whole. Thunder does not force the earth to respond; the earth responds because it is in its nature to respond. True enthusiasm is this resonance: the inner truth meeting the outer moment, and everything moving together.",

    rendering: "Enthusiasm. It furthers one to install helpers and to set armies marching."

  judgment: "Enthusiasm. It furthers one to install helpers and to set armies marching. When enthusiasm is genuine, it moves not just you but others. This is the time to gather those who will help, to set in motion what needs to be done. But be careful: enthusiasm can be false. It can be the excitement of the ego, not the resonance of the whole. True enthusiasm is recognized by its effects: it builds, it unites, it moves forward without leaving wreckage behind.",
  image: "Thunder comes resounding out of the earth. The image of Enthusiasm. The ancient kings made music in order to honor merit, and offered it with splendor to the Supreme Deity, inviting their ancestors to be present. Thunder from the earth: this is the sound of something deep rising up. The ancient kings understood this. They made music—not for entertainment, but for honor. They offered it with splendor—not for show, but for connection. They invited their ancestors—not as ghosts, but as presence. This is enthusiasm: the deep past resonating with the present moment, creating something that honors what is highest.",

    "Enthusiasm that expresses itself brings misfortune. The enthusiasm is real, but it is expressed too soon, too loudly, too completely. It spills out before it is ready. This brings misfortune—not because enthusiasm is wrong, but because its expression is mistimed. Hold it. Let it build. Then express it when the time is right.",
    "Firm as a rock. Not a whole day. Perseverance brings good fortune. You are firm as a rock in the midst of enthusiasm. You do not get swept away. You see clearly, and you act quickly—not a whole day of hesitation. This clarity in the midst of excitement brings good fortune. You can ride the enthusiasm without being consumed by it.",
    "Enthusiasm that looks upward creates remorse. Hesitation brings remorse. You look upward for enthusiasm—to leaders, to gurus, to external sources. This creates remorse because the enthusiasm is not yours. But hesitation also brings remorse because you are not moving. The solution: find the enthusiasm within. Do not look up; look in. Then move.",
    "The source of enthusiasm. He achieves great things. Doubt not. You gather friends around you as a hair clasp gathers the hair. Here is the source of enthusiasm: not in you alone, but in the gathering. You achieve great things because you are not alone. Doubt not. And like a hair clasp that gathers scattered hair into order, you gather friends around you. Not by force, but by the natural pull of shared purpose.",
    "Persistently ill, and still does not die. When enthusiasm is misplaced, when it is sustained by something that should have ended, you are like one who is persistently ill. You do not die, but you do not live either. You linger. This is the danger of enthusiasm without truth: it keeps you in a state of suspended animation. Recognize it. End it. Or accept the lingering.",
    "Deluded enthusiasm. But if after completion one changes, there is no blame. You have been deluded—your enthusiasm was false, misplaced, based on illusion. But if, after seeing this, you change, there is no blame. The delusion is not the failure; the refusal to change is. See clearly. Change course. No blame follows."

    description: "Earth below, thunder above. The thunder rolls across the earth, and the earth responds. This is enthusiasm: the outer stimulus meeting the inner capacity to respond. The earth does not resist the thunder; it vibrates with it. The thunder does not force the earth; it simply sounds, and the earth answers. Together, they create the resonance that moves all things."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The sage manages affairs without action and conveys teachings without words. The ten thousand things arise, and the sage does not turn away.' Hexagram 16 is the sage's enthusiasm: not the frantic doing of the ego, but the responsive stillness that allows all things to arise. Thunder does not try to move the earth; it simply sounds. Earth does not try to respond; it simply vibrates. In your own enthusiasm, find this same naturalness. Do not manufacture excitement; do not suppress it either. Let it arise when it arises. Let it sound when it sounds. The earth knows how to respond. You do too."
