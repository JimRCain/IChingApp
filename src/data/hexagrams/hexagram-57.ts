  heart: "Wind over wind. Gentle, penetrating, persistent. The Gentle is the power of influence without force, of persuasion without argument. Wind does not break the tree; it bends it over time. It does not command the clouds; it moves them. In human life, the gentle approach is often the most powerful: a soft word turns away wrath, a steady presence changes hearts. The wise one does not push; they permeate.",

    chinese: "巽。小亨，利有攸往，利見大人。",
    rendering: "The Gentle. Success in small matters. It furthers one to undertake something. It furthers one to see the great person."
  },
  judgment: "The gentle way succeeds in small matters—the daily interactions, the subtle influences. It furthers one to undertake something, because gentle action, persistently applied, accomplishes much. It furthers to see the great person—one who embodies this gentle power, who can teach you its ways. The wind does not strive; it simply moves. In its moving, it shapes mountains. So too, your gentle persistence will shape your world.",
  image: "Winds following one another. The noble one spreads his commands and carries out his affairs. Wind after wind: influence compounding, messages spreading. The noble one learns: spread your commands—not by shouting, but by letting them be carried. Carry out your affairs—not by forcing, but by persistent gentle action. The winds do not tire; they simply continue. So too, the noble one.",
  lines: [
    "Advancing and retreating. It furthers the perseverance of a warrior. The first movement of the gentle: advancing, then retreating—testing, feeling. This is not indecision; it is the warrior's reconnaissance. Perseverance in this probing furthers. Know the ground before you commit.",
    "The gentle beneath the bed. Priests and magicians are used in great number. Good fortune. No blame. The gentle so deep it goes under the bed—into the hidden, the unconscious. Priests and magicians—ritual, tradition—are used. Good fortune because you access the depths. No blame because you use what works.",
    "Repeatedly entering the gentle. Humiliation. To be too gentle, too yielding, too compliant—repeatedly entering the gentle—brings humiliation. The wind that always bends breaks nothing. Know when to be firm.",
    "Regret disappears. In the hunt, you catch three kinds of game. The gentle applied with purpose: regret disappears because you act effectively. In the hunt, you catch three kinds of game—success in multiple areas. The gentle way, when rightly directed, achieves much.",
    "Perseverance brings good fortune. Regret disappears. Nothing that does not further. No beginning, but an end. Before the change, three days. After the change, three days. Good fortune. The culmination: perseverance brings good fortune, regret dissolves, everything furthers. There is no beginning—you cannot trace the start of the gentle influence. But there is an end—a clear result. Three days before and after—the cycle of preparation and integration. Good fortune because the gentle way has become natural, effortless.",
    "The gentle beneath the bed. He loses his possessions and his axe. Perseverance brings misfortune. Too deep, too far: under the bed, he loses his tools—his axe, his means of acting. Perseverance in this hiddenness brings misfortune. Even the gentle must sometimes emerge."

    description: "Wind over wind. Influence upon influence. The Gentle is not a single breeze; it is the constant wind that shapes landscapes. It does not force; it persists. The wise one learns that the softest thing in the world can overcome the hardest, simply by continuing."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The softest thing in the world rides over the hardest thing in the world. That which has no substance enters where there is no space.' Hexagram 57 is the softest thing made manifest. The wind cannot be grasped, yet it moves mountains. The gentle cannot be resisted, yet it changes hearts. The sage does not argue, does not fight, does not insist. They simply continue, like wind over wind, and in time, all things yield."
