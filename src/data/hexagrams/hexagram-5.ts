  heart: "Clouds rising into heaven. Rain that has not yet fallen. Above, the vast openness of the sky; below, the gathering moisture. Nothing is wrong. Everything is exactly as it should be. But not yet complete. Waiting is not emptiness—it is fullness in suspension. The field does not curse the clouds for not releasing; it simply receives the shadow, the coolness, the promise. Waiting is the space between the promise and its fulfillment, and that space is sacred.",
  judgment: "There is a time when the only right action is to wait. Not passive waiting, not anxious waiting—but sincere waiting, trust-filled waiting. You have done what needed doing; now the clouds must fill in their own time. This waiting has a quality of light. It is not dark, not desperate. It is the patient expectancy of a farmer after planting, of a lover before meeting, of a painter before the first brushstroke. To wait with sincerity is to remain present, open, unforced. When the time ripens, you will cross the great water—the great difficulty—as if it were nothing, because you did not exhaust yourself against it too soon.",
  image: "Clouds rise up to heaven. The noble one eats and drinks, feasts with family and friends. The image is striking: clouds rise, but the rain does not fall. What does the wise one do? They do not stare anxiously at the sky. They do not pace and fret. They gather with those they love, share food, rest, nourish themselves. The waiting period is not empty time—it is time for replenishment. The fields cannot be forced to drink; the rain will come when the clouds are ready. Until then, tend to the human things. Eat. Drink. Be with your people. This waiting is itself a kind of harvest.",

    "Waiting in the meadow. It furthers one to abide in what endures. No blame. The meadow is open, grassy, peaceful—but exposed. You wait here, not yet in danger, but not yet sheltered. The key is to abide in what endures: your center, your practice, your connection to what is real beyond circumstance. Do not fill the waiting with distraction. Stay present in the open field, trusting that the enduring ground beneath you will hold.",
    "Waiting on the sand. There is some gossip. The end brings good fortune. The sand shifts, washes away. It is less stable than the meadow. Words begin—gossip, criticism, the small irritations of those who do not understand your waiting. The sand does not hold footprints well, and neither do their words. Do not grasp at them. Let the gossip wash away like tide on sand. The end brings good fortune because you did not let the small disturbances move you from your center.",
    "Waiting in the mud brings about the arrival of the enemy. Mud is not water and not land—it is the in-between that traps. If you wait here, in ambiguity, in half-measures, in the place where you are neither fully committed nor fully released, you attract what you do not want. The enemy arrives not because you are wrong, but because you are unclear. The mud itself calls them. If you find yourself here, recognize: the problem is not the enemy, but the muddy ground you chose.",
    "Waiting in blood. Get out of the pit. Blood means wounding, the cost of waiting too long in the wrong place. Perhaps you waited in the mud, and the enemy came. Perhaps you waited in the sand, and the gossip cut deeper than you admitted. Now you are wounded, in the pit. The only instruction is: get out. Not by heroic effort, but by seeing clearly that you cannot stay. The pit does not release you—you release the pit. Climb. Any direction that is up.",
    "Waiting at meat and drink. Perseverance brings good fortune. Here is the return to the image: clouds above, feast below. You have found your way back to nourishment. Not escape, not denial, but genuine replenishment. The waiting continues—the rain still has not fallen—but now you wait in the right way: surrounded by what sustains you, giving and receiving, resting in the presence of those who matter. This is not a retreat from the waiting; it is its deepest practice.",
    "You fall into the pit. Three uninvited guests arrive. Honor them, and in the end there is good fortune. Even after waiting well, after feasting, after climbing out—you can fall again. The pit is always there, somewhere. But now, when you fall, guests come. Not enemies, not gossip, not mud—guests. They arrive uninvited, unexpected. And the instruction is: honor them. These are the helpers sent by the waiting itself, the ones who appear when you are least in control. Honor them, and the pit becomes a doorway."
