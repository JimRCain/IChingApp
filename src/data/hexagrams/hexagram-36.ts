  heart: "Earth over fire. The sun setting, sinking below the plain. Light withdraws; darkness advances. This is darkening of the light—not the absence of light, but its concealment. The sun is still there, still burning, but hidden. In times of darkness, the wise one does not rage against the night; they wait, they preserve, they tend the inner flame. The light will return, but first, the darkness must be honored.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "明夷。利艱貞。",
    rendering: "Darkening of the Light. In adversity, perseverance furthers."
  },
  judgment: "There are times when light is obscured, when truth is hidden, when the good are oppressed. In such times, the only wisdom is to persevere in adversity. Not to fight the darkness directly—that would waste your light. But to preserve your inner flame, to tend it secretly, to wait. The sun does not struggle against the night; it simply continues its course, and in time, it rises again. Your perseverance in this hiddenness furthers not only your own survival but the eventual return of light.",
  image: "Earth over fire. The noble one governs the multitude with obscurity, yet remains bright within. Earth over fire: the light is hidden, but not extinguished. The noble one learns: in governing, sometimes you must be obscure, not drawing attention, not asserting. Yet within, remain bright. Your clarity is your own; do not let the outer darkness dim it. Govern with obscurity, but never lose the inner light.",

    "Darkening of the light during flight. He lowers his wings. The noble one, in travel, goes three days without eating. But he has somewhere to go. The host has cause to speak. When the light is darkened, even in flight you must lower your wings, go unnoticed. You may go without food, endure hardship. But you have somewhere to go—a purpose, a destination. Even the host who does not understand you will have cause to speak of your perseverance.",
    "Darkening of the light. He is wounded in the left thigh. He uses a horse to rise again. Good fortune. Wounded, but not fatally. The left thigh—not the center, not the heart. You can still move, still rise, with help—the horse that carries you. Good fortune comes because you do not let the wound stop you. You find a way to go on.",
    "Darkening of the light during the hunt in the south. Their great leader is captured. Misfortune. To hunt, to seek, to strive—in times of darkness, this leads to capture. The great leader, the one you follow, is taken. Misfortune because you sought when you should have hidden. Learn: in darkness, do not hunt; wait.",
    "He penetrates the left side of the belly. He grasps the heart of the darkening of the light. And leaves through the gate and courtyard. To go to the heart of the darkness, to understand it from within—this is the way of the sage. He enters, grasps, then leaves. He is not trapped because he does not cling. He understands, and that understanding frees him.",
    "Darkening of the light as with the prince of Ji. Perseverance furthers. The prince of Ji was a wise man who feigned madness to survive in dark times. His perseverance in this self-concealment furthered not only his own life but the preservation of wisdom for later. In darkness, sometimes you must appear less than you are to preserve what you truly are.",
    "Not bright but dark. He first ascends to heaven, then plunges into the earth. The one who was not bright within, who had no inner light, ascends only to fall. Without inner flame, there is no anchor; you rise with the times and fall with them. The darkening consumes you because you were never truly lit."

    description: "Fire below, earth above. The light is hidden, buried under earth. This is darkening of the light: the brightness is still there, but concealed. In times of darkness, remember: the sun has not died; it has simply gone underground. It will rise again."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'He who knows the masculine and keeps to the feminine becomes the valley of the world.' Hexagram 36 is the masculine hidden within the feminine, the light concealed within the dark. The wise one in dark times does not fight; they yield, they hide, they wait. They become the valley that holds the seed of light until the sun returns. This is not cowardice; it is the deepest wisdom."
