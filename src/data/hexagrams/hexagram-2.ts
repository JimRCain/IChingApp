  heart: "Six broken lines. Earth receiving heaven. The mare running across the endless plain, asking nothing, becoming everything. Where the Creative gives birth to ideas, the Receptive brings them into form. It does not initiate—it completes. It does not command—it supports. This is not weakness. The earth does not struggle to be fertile; it simply opens, and life springs forth.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "坤。元亨利牝馬之貞。君子有攸往，先迷後得主，利。西南得朋，東北喪朋。安貞吉。",
    rendering: "THE RECEPTIVE brings about sublime success, Furthering through the perseverance of a mare. If the superior person undertakes something and tries to lead, they go astray; but if they follow, they find guidance. It is favorable to find friends in the west and south, to forego friends in the east and north. Quiet perseverance brings good fortune."
  },
  judgment: "There is a power in you that does not push—it receives. Like soil receiving rain, like the valley receiving the stream, like the mare running not to conquer the plain but to become one with it. This is the perseverance of the mare: not stubbornness, but faithful, steady movement within the whole. To try to lead here is to lose the way. To follow—not weakly, but with full presence—is to find guidance. The Receptive teaches that some things come only when we stop reaching for them. They arrive in the space we have held open.",
  image: "The earth's condition is receptive devotion. Thus the superior person carries the outer world with broad virtue. The earth does not select what it receives. It accepts rain and drought, seed and stone, the footstep and the resting body. Its virtue is its vast capacity to hold all things without judgment. In the same way, the wise one develops a heart wide enough to contain the world—not to control it, but to support it. This is true strength: to carry without complaint, to hold without possessing.",
  allLines: "When all the lines are sixes, it means: Lasting perseverance furthers. Do not seek to lead; follow and find guidance. Good fortune in quiet steadiness.",
  lines: [
    "Hoarfrost underfoot. Solid ice follows. The first sign—a chill in the air, frost on the grass. It seems small, insignificant. But frost is the beginning of ice. The Receptive teaches through accumulation. What you allow today, you invite tomorrow. Not as punishment, but as nature. Tend the small beginnings, for they become your ground.",
    "Straight, square, great. No need for practice, nothing that does not further. The earth is straight—it follows its nature without deviation. It is square—it contains all things within its four directions. It is great—it holds everything without exception. When you are simply yourself, fully, without pretense, your actions become like the earth: direct, containing, vast. You need not practice being what you already are.",
    "Hidden lines. One can remain persevering. If by chance you are in the service of a king, seek not works, but bring to completion. Sometimes the way is to be invisible. Not hidden because you are hiding, but hidden because the work does not need your name on it. Like the earth that supports the tree without needing to be seen in its branches, you complete things without claiming them. This is not self-effacement—it is the wisdom of knowing when your presence is the gift, not your label.",
    "A tied-up sack. No blame, no praise. There are times when the wise one binds themselves like a sack—closed, contained, revealing nothing. This is not fear; it is appropriateness. When the world is not ready to receive, or when your inner work requires silence, you close. No blame follows, because you have harmed nothing. But also no praise, because praise comes from opening. Learn when to tie the sack, and when to loosen it.",
    "A yellow lower garment. Supreme good fortune. Yellow is the color of earth, of the center, of balance. A lower garment is humble, close to the ground, yet essential. To wear yellow is to be rooted in the center. To wear the lower garment is to be content with what supports, not what shines. This is supreme good fortune: to be exactly where you belong, doing exactly what is yours to do, asking nothing more.",
    "Dragons fight in the meadow. Their blood is black and yellow. When the receptive forgets its nature and tries to become creative, conflict follows. Dragons—creatures of heaven—descend to the meadow, the realm of earth. They fight. Their blood, the mingling of heaven (black) and earth (yellow), stains the grass. This is what happens when yielding becomes striving, when supporting becomes competing. The blood is not punishment—it is the natural consequence of being what you are not. Stay in your ground."

    description: "Earth above earth. Devotion that deepens devotion. Not passivity, but active, faithful presence. The lower earth is your inner ground—your capacity to receive your own experience without judgment. The upper earth is your outer expression—your way of holding others with the same unconditional acceptance. When they are the same, you become ground for yourself and others."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The supreme good is like water. It benefits all things without contention. It stays in lowly places that others despise. Thus it is near the Tao.' Hexagram 2 is water's elder sister—earth itself. Even lower than water, even more receptive. Earth asks nothing, claims nothing, yet all things return to it in the end. This is the power of true humility: not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less. The mare does not try to be fast like the dragon; she runs her own run, and in that running, she is complete. The Receptive teaches that to follow is not to be less—it is to find the one thing you were always meant to complete, and to complete it without needing to be seen doing so."
