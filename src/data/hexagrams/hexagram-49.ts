  heart: "Lake over fire. The lake flows downward, fire burns upward. Their movements oppose, creating tension that can only be resolved through transformation. Revolution is this: the necessary change that comes when the old can no longer contain the new. Like a snake shedding its skin, like a phoenix rising from ashes. The old must die for the new to be born. But revolution is not undertaken lightly; it comes only when the time is ripe, when the old order has exhausted itself.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "革。巳日乃孚，元亨利貞，悔亡。",
    rendering: "Revolution. On your own day you are believed. Supreme success. Perseverance furthers. Remorse disappears."
  },
  judgment: "Revolution requires the right timing—on your own day, when you are believed. Not before, not after. When the time is right, supreme success follows. Perseverance in the new order furthers all things. Remorse disappears because the change was necessary, inevitable. Revolution is not chaos; it is the restoration of order when the old order has become corrupt. But be certain: only undertake revolution when there is no other way. The old must be truly exhausted before the new can take root.",
  image: "Lake over fire. The image of Revolution. The noble one sets the calendar in order and makes the seasons clear. Lake over fire: an unnatural union, a contradiction that cannot last. The noble one learns: when the old order is contradicted by reality, set things in order. Make the seasons clear—mark the new time, the new beginning. Revolution is not just destruction; it is the establishment of a new calendar, a new way of marking time.",

    "Undertaking brings misfortune. Perseverance brings danger. When talk of revolution has gone the rounds three times, one may commit himself, and men will believe him.",
    "Remorse disappears. Men believe him. Changing the form of government brings good fortune.",
    "The great man changes like a tiger. Even before he questions the oracle, he is believed.",
    "The noble man changes like a panther. The inferior man molts in the face. Undertaking brings misfortune. To remain persevering brings good fortune."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The ten thousand things arise, and I watch their return. Each thing flourishes, then returns to its root.' Hexagram 49 is the return that comes through revolution. The old must return to the root so the new can arise. The wise one does not cling to the old; they watch it die, and welcome the new. Revolution is the Tao's way of renewing itself."
