  heart: "Every beginning is covered in mist. The mountain does not call the stream to itself—the stream finds its own way down, filling each hollow, learning the shape of the land as it flows. There is nothing wrong with not knowing. The trouble begins only when we pretend to know, or when we ask the same question again and again, hoping for a different answer.",
  ancient: {
    chinese: "蒙。亨。匪我求童蒙。童蒙求我。初筮告。再三瀆。瀆則不告。利貞。",
    rendering: "Youthful folly has success. I do not seek the young and inexperienced; they seek me. At the first casting, I instruct. If they ask two or three times, that is troublesome. To the troublesome, I give no instruction. Perseverance furthers."
  },
  judgment: "The Sage does not chase after students. Wisdom cannot be forced on anyone. But when a true seeker arrives—humble, open, ready—the teaching appears naturally, like water finding its level.",
  image: "A spring rises at the foot of the mountain. The noble one nurtures character by being thorough in all things. The spring does not leap to the valley in one bound. It fills each depression, seeps through each layer of stone, moves steadily and patiently. In the same way, we develop ourselves by attending to each small thing, skipping nothing. Character builds not in grand gestures but in the patient filling of every hollow place.",
  lines: [
    "Releasing ignorance. Using punishment to correct, removing the shackles. But persisting in punishment leads to regret. There is a time for discipline, for breaking the hard crust of old habits. But punishment alone cannot teach—it only restrains. The goal is to remove the shackles from the mind, not add more. If all you do is punish, you create a prisoner, not a student.",
    "Embracing the ignorant with patience brings good fortune. Receiving even the simplest teachings. Like a son who can sustain his family. True strength is gentle. The one who teaches does not disdain the simplest question or the humblest student. Like a son who has matured enough to care for his parents, the wise one holds space for growth without judgment. This 包容 (bāoróng)—the capacity to contain and accept what is still forming.",
    "Do not take this one as a companion. Seeing gold, they forget themselves. Nothing fruitful comes. This line warns against those who have no center. They chase after glitter, lose themselves in every new opportunity, and cannot be relied upon. But it also speaks to us: do not let your wanting exceed your integrity. When you forget yourself in pursuit of gain, you become someone no one should trust.",
    "Bound in the chains of ignorance. Regret. This is the ignorance that comes from isolation. Cut off from those who are solid, stuck only with others who also don't know, the fool becomes entrenched. Regret follows—not as punishment, but as the natural consequence of refusing to grow.",
    "Childlike ignorance. Good fortune. Here is the innocence we started with, but now it's chosen, not accidental. Complete openness. The mind that does not already know, so it can actually learn. This is the fertile emptiness the Tao Te Ching speaks of—the vessel that can be filled because it is not already full. Good fortune indeed.",
    "Striking the ignorant. No advantage in injury. Advantage in warding off harm. When ignorance hardens into arrogance, there is a temptation to strike, to force understanding through violence. This never works—it only creates more resistance. Better to protect the fool from the consequences of their own folly where possible, while letting them learn at their own pace. You cannot beat wisdom into anyone."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.' Hexagram 4 honors a certain kind of not-knowing. Not the ignorance that refuses to learn, but the innocence that remains open. The spring does not know where it's going—it only knows how to flow, and the mountain teaches it the way by simply being there."
