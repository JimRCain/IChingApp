  heart: "Thunder above, wind below. The thunder rolls; the wind blows. Both are movement, but movement that endures. This is duration: not the stillness that never changes, but the movement that maintains its direction. The thunder does not stop being thunder; the wind does not stop being wind. They move, but they remain themselves. This is the nature of duration: to change while remaining true.",

  judgment: "Duration. Success. No blame. Perseverance furthers. It furthers one to have somewhere to go. Duration is not stagnation. It is the movement that maintains its direction. Success follows because the movement is true. No blame—there is nothing to correct. Perseverance furthers—the duration deepens over time. It furthers one to have somewhere to go—duration is not aimless. It has direction. Know your direction. Move toward it. Endure.",
  image: "Thunder and wind. The image of Duration. The noble one stands firm and does not change their direction. Thunder and wind: both are movement, but movement that endures. The thunder rolls; the wind blows. They do not stop. The noble one learns from this: to stand firm, to not change direction. Not because they are rigid, but because they are true. The direction is right. The movement is right. Endure.",

    "Seeking duration too hastily brings misfortune persistently. Nothing that would further. You seek duration too hastily—you want the endurance before you have earned it. This brings misfortune. Nothing furthers. Duration cannot be forced. It must be lived. Slow down. Let the duration come naturally.",
    "Remorse disappears. You are able to remain in the middle for a long time. Remorse disappears. You are able to remain in the middle—for a long time. This is duration: not the extreme, but the center. Not the flash, but the steady burn. Remain in the middle. Endure.",
    "He who does not give duration to their character meets with disgrace. Enduring humiliation. You do not give duration to your character—you change too often, you shift too easily. This meets with disgrace. Enduring humiliation is the consequence. The character that does not endure is not character. It is performance. Be consistent. Endure.",
    "No game in the field. You hunt without duration. No game in the field. You hunt—but you do not have duration. The game is not there because you are not there. You are scattered. You are not present. Duration requires presence. Be present. The game will come.",
    "Giving duration to one's character through perseverance. This is good fortune for a woman, misfortune for a man. Giving duration to character through perseverance. This is good fortune for a woman—misfortune for a man. Why? Because the woman's duration is inward—the character that endures. The man's duration must be outward—the action that endures. Know your duration. Live it.",
    "Restlessness as an enduring condition brings misfortune. Restlessness as an enduring condition—this is contradiction. Restlessness cannot endure. It brings misfortune. The duration you seek is not restlessness. It is steadiness. Calm the restlessness. Find the steady movement. That is duration."

    description: "Wind below, thunder above. Both are movement—the wind that blows, the thunder that rolls. But this is not chaotic movement. It is movement that endures. The wind continues; the thunder continues. This is duration: the movement that maintains its direction. Not the stillness that never changes, but the movement that remains true."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The Tao is forever doing, yet never done.' Hexagram 32 is this forever-doing made visible. The Tao does not stop; it moves. But it moves in the same direction—always returning, always flowing. This is duration: not the rigid that breaks, but the flexible that endures. The wind bends; the thunder rolls. They do not stop. They do not change direction. In your own life, find this same duration. Do not be rigid. Do not be scattered. Be the steady movement. Be the enduring direction. The Tao moves forever. So can you."
