  heart: "Earth above, lake below. The earth sinks toward the lake; the lake rises to meet it. This is approach: the coming together of what has been separate. Not the sudden collision of opposites, but the gradual, natural drawing near. The earth does not command the lake to rise; the lake does not demand the earth to sink. They simply move toward each other, as things do when their time has come.",

  judgment: "Approach has supreme success. Perseverance furthers. In the eighth month there is misfortune. The time of approach is a time of great possibility. What was distant draws near; what was separate begins to meet. Supreme success is possible if you persevere in the right way. But there is a warning: in the eighth month there is misfortune. This is not superstition; it is the recognition that all things cycle. The approach that brings success will, in time, bring its opposite. Enjoy the approach, but do not cling to it. Know that the eighth month comes for all things.",
  image: "The earth above the lake. The image of Approach. The noble one is inexhaustible in their will to teach, and without limits in their tolerance and protection of the people. The earth above the lake: the high place over the low place. But this is not domination; it is care. The noble one learns from this: to be inexhaustible in teaching, without limits in tolerance and protection. The earth does not tire of holding the lake; the lake does not resist the earth. This is the nature of true approach: the willingness to give without end, to hold without condition.",

    "Joint approach. Perseverance brings good fortune. You do not approach alone; you approach together, in joint effort. This shared approach brings good fortune if you persevere. The work is not yours alone; it is ours. And in this sharing, the approach succeeds.",
    "Joint approach. Good fortune. Everything furthers. Again, joint approach—but now the emphasis is on the good fortune itself. Everything furthers when the approach is shared. Not because the work is easier, but because the burden is divided and the joy is multiplied.",
    "Comfortable approach. Nothing that would further. If one is induced to grieve over it, one becomes free of blame. The approach is comfortable, easy, without challenge. This sounds good, but nothing furthers. Growth requires some friction. If you recognize this, if you grieve over the missed opportunity, you become free of blame. The grief itself is the correction. Feel it. Learn. Move on.",
    "Complete approach. No blame. The approach is complete—nothing held back, nothing reserved. You give yourself fully to the meeting, to the drawing near. This brings no blame because you have not deceived yourself or others. You have approached with your whole being.",
    "Wise approach. This is right for a great prince. Good fortune. The approach is wise—not naive, not desperate, not blind. You see clearly what you are approaching and why. This is right for a great prince—for one who leads, who influences, who carries responsibility. Good fortune follows because wisdom and power are aligned.",
    "Great-hearted approach. Good fortune. No blame. The approach is great-hearted—generous, open, without smallness. You do not approach to take; you approach to give. This brings good fortune and no blame. The great heart cannot fail in approach because it does not measure success by what it gains."

    description: "Lake below, earth above. The earth descends toward the lake; the lake rises to meet it. This is approach: the mutual movement toward each other. The earth does not stay in its height; it comes down. The lake does not stay in its depth; it reaches up. Together, they create the meeting that is approach. Not one approaching the other, but both approaching the middle."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'The great Tao flows everywhere, both to the left and to the right. The ten thousand things depend on it for life, and it does not abandon them.' Hexagram 19 is the Tao approaching. Not the distant god who must be summoned, but the near presence that is already here. The earth approaches the lake; the lake approaches the earth. The Tao approaches you; you approach the Tao. In this mutual approach, there is no winner and no loser, no high and no low. There is only the meeting. And in the meeting, supreme success. But remember the eighth month. All approaches end. All meetings part. This is not tragedy; it is nature. Approach fully while you can. Let go fully when you must."
