  name: "The Taming Power of the Great (大畜 - Dà Chù)",
  heart: "Mountain above, heaven below. The mountain contains heaven—the vast power held within the solid form. This is the taming power of the great: not the suppression of power, but the holding of it, the containing of it until the time is right. Heaven is strong; the mountain is still. Together, they create the capacity to hold great power without releasing it prematurely. This is the wisdom of timing.",

  judgment: "The Taming Power of the Great. Perseverance furthers. Not eating at home brings good fortune. It furthers one to cross the great water. Great power is being held. This is not the time to use it all. Perseverance furthers—the holding requires strength. Not eating at home: go out, engage with the world, do not hoard your power in private. This brings good fortune. And when the time is right, you can cross the great water. The power you have held will carry you through.",
  image: "Heaven within the mountain. The image of the Taming Power of the Great. The noble one acquaints themselves with many sayings of antiquity and many deeds of the past, in order to strengthen their character. Heaven is within the mountain—the vast contained by the solid. The noble one learns from this: to strengthen their character, they study the past. They learn from the sayings of antiquity, the deeds of those who came before. This is the taming of the great: to hold the wisdom of ages, to contain it, to let it strengthen you.",

    "Danger is at hand. It furthers one to desist. The danger is at hand. Do not proceed. It furthers one to desist—to stop, to wait, to hold back. This is not cowardice; it is wisdom. The great power is not yet ready to be released. Wait.",
    "The axletrees are taken from the wagon. The axletrees are removed—the wheels cannot turn. You are stopped. This is not misfortune; it is protection. The time is not right. Do not force the wagon to move. Wait for the axletrees to be returned.",

    "The headboard of a young bull. Great good fortune. The headboard is on the young bull—the restraint is in place. This brings great good fortune because the bull is being tamed while it is still young. The power is being held before it becomes destructive. This is the wisdom of early restraint.",
    "The tusk of a gelded boar. Good fortune. The tusk of a gelded boar—the power is there, but it is tempered. This brings good fortune. The boar is still strong, but it is no longer dangerous. This is the taming of the great: not the destruction of power, but the tempering of it.",

    description: "Heaven below, mountain above. The mountain contains heaven—the vast power held within the solid form. This is the taming power of the great: the strong contained by the still, the movement held by the mountain. The power is not suppressed; it is gathered. When the time is right, it will be released with great effect."

  taoist_reflection: "The Tao Te Ching says: 'Knowing when to stop, you can be safe.' Hexagram 26 is the teaching of holding power without using it. The mountain does not release the heaven within it; it contains it. The sage does not use all their power; they hold it. This is not weakness; it is wisdom. The power that is held is greater than the power that is spent. In your own life, learn to hold your power. Do not spend it all. Do not release it prematurely. Wait. Gather. Strengthen. And when the time comes, you will cross the great water with ease."
