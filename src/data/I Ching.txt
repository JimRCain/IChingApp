The Creative does not grasp; it radiates.",

The sage works all day, then returns to silence. Can you?",

The sky does not try to be vast; it is vast, and so it holds the stars. The sage does not try to lead; they are real, and so others follow—not because they are pushed, but because they recognize something they already carry within themselves.

It accepts rain and drought, seed and stone, the footstep and the resting body. Its virtue is its vast capacity to hold all things without judgment.

To pursue something without the proper guide, without understanding the territory, is to lose yourself in the thicket. The forester knows the land, knows the habits of the deer. If you hunt without them, you will stumble in blindness. There are times when giving up is not failure—it is the wisdom of recognizing you are not ready. The noble one reads the signs and knows when to wait.",
    "Horse and wagon part. Seek union. To go brings good fortune. Everything acts favorably. After the separation, the seeking. The horse that left now returns, or a new horse appears. The scattering was not permanent—it was the clearing of space for a truer joining. Now you can seek, and the seeking itself is blessed. The movement that was forbidden in the first line is now possible, because the ground has been tested, the helpers gathered, the timing matured. Go now.",
    "Difficulties in blessing. A little perseverance brings good fortune. Great perseverance brings misfortune. A small kindness offered at the right moment waters the struggling sprout. But to pour a flood on it, to try to force growth with great effort, drowns it. You are being blessed, but the blessing comes drop by drop. Accept the little that is given. Do not demand the full abundance before the plant can hold it. Patience in receiving is as important as patience in striving.",

Supreme good fortune follows not because the match is advantageous, but because it is true.",

Commands now come from the common people, not from above. The time of peace has passed, and the time of returning has begun. Perseverance here, trying to hold onto peace, brings danger.

The small preponderance has not yet become the great. The prince shoots and hits—a small action, precise, effective. In the cave, in hiddenness, the small act achieves what great force could not.",
    "He passes by, does not meet. The flying bird leaves him. Misfortune. This means calamity and injury. To pass by and not meet, to fly and miss connection—this is the misfortune of the small preponderance when it is not rightly handled. The bird leaves; the song is lost. Calamity and injury follow because the small was not attended to in time."

Hexagram 62 is the light and restless in excess, the heavy and still as the remedy. When the small preponderates, return to the heavy, the still, the low. Descend, do not ascend. The bird that flies too high meets misfortune; the bird that stays near the earth hears its own song. The sage in times of imbalance does not seek to dominate; they become more humble, more careful, more still. In this, they become the root that stabilizes all."
